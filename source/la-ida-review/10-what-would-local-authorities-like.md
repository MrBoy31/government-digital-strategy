        HMG approach

    -   To be given advice on technology – how do we go about this

-   Standards and framework:

    -   To be provided with a clear set of common standards and
        accredited processes so that it is clear what providers are
        delivering in terms of trust and authenticated individuals

    -   To have a common set of standards and a common approach that
        apply across LAs and the whole public sector

    -   A framework identifying how it could work nationally with
        certified trusted 3^rd^ parties even if only for specific types
