##09 Perceived Barriers and Issues

A number of commonly perceived barriers and issues were identified as
putting at risk the achievement of the full visions for online IdA.

Gaining consensus across the organization (LA) and understanding of
purpose, LA financial constraints, lack of consistent data (e.g. in one
authority over 15,000 duplicate records have been detected) and lack of
data accuracy (LA staff inputting data do not always recognise the
importance of completeness and accuracy) are cited as the most common
challenges.

Trust has a number of facets including residual fears for citizens that
this may be ID cards by another name, that citizens may not trust
government or 3^rd^ parties with their data and that IdA procedures are
appropriate to the service being accessed. Ownership was a concern in
terms of identifying who owns particular information and in terms of
service vs corporate ownership. Although there was no specific legal
question cited, it was felt that there could be issues around LA legal
teams being familiar enough with the concepts of federation and with
social care considerations: there could be a tendency to hide behind the
data protection act when understanding is limited. Accessibility and
usability of the process are seen as important aspects to get right for
citizens.

Both organizational and societal culture, and embedded service
suppliersâ€™ reluctance to embrace any other solution than that developed
by themselves, were cited by some as potentially creating difficulties.

Other barriers were mentioned but not by as many participants.
