##02 Introduction

###Purpose of this Report

This report presents the findings of a review commissioned by the
Cabinet Office Identity Assurance Programmeâ€™s Local Government Advisory
Group in July 2012.

Objectives of the review were:

-   To provide an overview of current practices and needs for
    establishing online citizen identities in local authorities

-   To investigate local authority challenges and barriers to
    implementing online citizen identity assurance (IdA).


###Review Design

The review was designed as a small scale survey of LAs.

The findings in this report should not be taken as a definitive
representation of all authorities in the UK[^1],
however it is emphasised that they do provide a solid evidence based
illustration of the current status and plans for the future of many
authorities.
