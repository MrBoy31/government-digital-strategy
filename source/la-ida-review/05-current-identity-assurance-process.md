##05 Current Identity Assurance Processes

###Overview

Each local authority manages a number of different ways in which to
register, authorize and authenticate online service users.

This is in large part due to IdA processes having been developed as
individual service needs have arisen. More recent trends though are
towards rationalizing the number of times a citizen is asked to
register/sign-on by developing a service grouping approach.

Many of the online services can be accessed anonymously (or
pseudonymously) and do not require citizens to be authenticated. However
many of these also offer the opportunity for citizens to register by
providing an email address and setting up a password in order that they
can track progress of, for example a fault repair, or be notified with
updates.

Some authorities also offer a federated option of signing up for updates
(assurance level 0) using existing Yahoo, Google or Facebook logins

The majority of transactional services require no or low levels of
assurance and simply need a mechanism to communicate with an individual
whose real identity does not need to be established. There are of course
some transactions (such as making applications, renewing library books,
requesting a service) that demand higher levels of confidence in
someone’s identity and therefore ask for further evidence either
electronically, by post or in person.

LAs reported that between 10 and 100 services require some level of
assurance but exact details on which services require which level of
assurance within each LA were not available for this review. The range
is due to differences in LA size, responsibilities, level of advancement
in digital delivery of services and differing views of which services
require which level of assurance.

###Levels of Assurance

Levels of assurance were generally referred to in one of two ways,
either numerically (levels 0 – 3) or by colour (Bronze, Silver, Gold).

In relation to online services, no service requiring assurance above
level 2 was identified. The newly developing online services for
personal budgets and associated e-Marketplace for social service needs
and health and social care support may fall into this category but
although it is currently being considered and assessed, within the scope
of this review no definitive standards or procedures for assurance were
identified.

###Identity Assurance Procedures

Although there are some differences in when and how IdA is stipulated,
in general requirements and procedures for assurance follow a similar
pattern.

####Assurance Level 0

Services such as looking for support and advice online, reporting a
fault or in some cases paying a bill/fine requiring no level of
assurance (Level 0) can be accessed without the need to register (some
authorities expressed the view that as long as a bill/fine was paid
there was no need to identify the individual making the payment). To add
value to the service however (such as enable tracking of a repair or
emailing progress) citizens may be invited to register remotely and may
be asked to provide all or some of the following:

-   Name

-   Address

-   Email address

-   Username/userid

-   Password

-   Challenge/response information.

The citizen may choose whether to authenticate to the service by input
of identifying credentials such as:

-   Username/userid

-   Password

-   Email address.

####Assurance Level 1 and Bronze

Services such as requesting social care help or paying a bill/fine
requiring second level of assurance (Level 1 or Bronze) require citizens
to identify themselves so that there is a degree of confidence that they
are who they say they are. Citizens may still register remotely and are
generally required to provide information such as:

-   Name

-   Address

-   Date of birth

-   Email address

-   Username/userid

-   Password

-   Challenge/response information.

Authentication to the service may then require input of identifying
credentials such as:

-   Username/userid

-   Password

-   Email address.

####Assurance Level 2 and Silver

Citizens may still register remotely but access to services requiring
third level of assurance (Level 2 or Silver) requires further
validation. This additional validation may be undertaken remotely and/or
in person, depending upon the service and the policy of the authority or
service owner. For example school admissions, library membership,
resident’s parking permit, housing and council tax benefit applications.
In addition to online registration of the kind of information listed
above, there may be additional information required such as:

-   Gender

-   Unique identifier that has been sent to the home address

-   National insurance number.

Additional online steps may be required:

-   Response to an email to confirm email address

-   Response to an email to activate an account using an emailed code.

There may also be further steps to validate identity requiring:

-   Presentation (via post, scanning or F2F) of documents such as:

    -   driving licence

    -   proof of car ownership

    -   proof of residency

    -   Council Tax bills

    -   utility bills

    -   payslips

    -   tenancy agreements.

Authentication to the service may then require input of identifying
credentials such as:

-   Userid/username

-   Password

-   Email address

-   Unique identifier

-   Membership number and pin.

####Assurance Level 3 and Gold

Although no online service requiring the highest level of assurance
(i.e. requiring registration and validation through in-person appearance
along with appropriate documentation) was identified, Housing/Council
Tax Benefit may for other pragmatic reasons (e.g. better efficiency
through guaranteed quality of data) be processed F2F.

###Single Sign-on Approaches

A number of authorities encourage their citizens to register once for a
range of services or to provide a more personalized experience.
Typically this will capture limited personal information that will
enable the citizen to access a group of services or to customize their
web visits without having to re-enter their name, address etc. Examples
of this are:

| **Account**           |    **Facilities Included**                                            |
|:--------------------- |:--------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| My Newham             | Reporting problems<br/>Requesting services<br/>Making payments<br/>Checking Council Tax |
| Me@WCC                | Fast form completion<br/>Saving forms for later completion<br/>Tracking correspondence |
| Myeastriding          | Managing customer service calls<br/>Managing email alerts<br/>Managing Council Tax |
| My Hantsweb           | Personal homepage<br/>Displaying location relevant information<br/>Presenting topics of interest
| My Account (Bristol)  | Paying Council Tax<br/>Paying Business Rates<br/>Applying for Benefits<br/>Landlord's services |
| Citizen’s Account (Rushmoor) | View Council Tax<br/>View Benefits Payments<br/>View Landlord’s Payments |

Registration and validation for single sign-on is remote and typically
requires a citizen to enter details such as:

-   Name

-   Address

-   Email address

-   Telephone number

-   Mobile number

-   User name

-   Password

-   2 – 3 challenge/response details.

A single sign-on may not automatically authenticate an individual to a
service however, in some cases (e.g. My Account in Bristol and Citizen’s
Account in Rushmoor), initial registration is then followed by service
enrolment which may require additional validating data including:

-   Account/reference number

-   Date of birth

-   National Insurance number.

###Identity Assurance Interfaces

The anonymous, pseudonymous and single sign-ons are in addition to
services requiring higher levels of authentication such as housing
benefit applications, library book renewals and reservations and online
school admissions. This has resulted in a number of different types of
interfaces such as:

-   In-house developed interface for single sign-on to a group of
    services (e.g. Me@WCC)

-   In-house developed interface for each service (e.g. some school
    admissions systems); interface may appear similar or dissimilar
    depending upon whether a corporate or service by service strategy is
    in place

-   Individual application supplier interface (e.g. Hera by Halarose for
    electoral registration); interfaces are likely to be different for
    each service

-   Generic interface for multiple services (e.g. CitizenSafe, Gandlake)

For the citizen, this can result in a poor usability experience; not
only are they faced with entering the same identity information numerous
times but there is no consistent look and feel of the registration
validation and authorization process.
