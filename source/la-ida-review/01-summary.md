##01 Executive Summary

This report provides an overview of the ways in which local authorities
(LAs) currently address online citizen identity assurance (IdA) and
offers an insight into the challenges and barriers LAs face in expanding
their online services within the context of digital service
transformation and citizen IdA. The report also makes recommendations on
actions that could be taken to inform and support LAs in implementing
their strategies and plans for online citizen IdA.

From telephone interviews with LA representatives from across the UK
some common themes emerged:

-   LAs may offer hundreds of online services but many of these are not
    transactional and do not require any form of citizen IdA. In many
    cases, citizens are nevertheless offered the opportunity to register
    in order that a ‘single view of the customer’ can be developed and
    the overall customer experience can be improved.

-   IdA for transactional online services is managed in a number of
    different ways within each LA. Registration, validation and
    authorisation may be through a single sign-on to a group of services
    or multiple sign-on to many different services. Both in-house
    developed and 3^rd^ party purchased solutions are in place. Citizens
    are often therefore required to register and identify themselves
    multiple times in different ways to the same organisation.

-   Levels of assurance for each service are generally determined
    locally and are either referred to in terms of a number (0-3) or
    colour (bronze-gold). LAs offer online services requiring levels of
    assurance 0, 1 and 2 (bronze and silver) but no examples of online
    services requiring assurance level 3 (gold) were identified.

-   LAs recognise that communicating the concepts of IdA to their
    citizens, particularly in relation to a federated approach, will be
    very challenging but it is suggested that establishment of a
    national approach and branding that can be trusted by the public
    would help.

-   Citizen trust may be difficult to achieve and it is suggested that
    demographic and customer insight studies could help to identify
    groups that might require digital assistance and the type of
    identity providers with whom they would be most familiar and
    therefore trust.

-   A number of LAs are in the process of investigating or reviewing the
    market place for an IdA solution and there is a common concern not
    to adopt a solution that will not align with a future national
    standardised approach. Additionally, LAs are considering future
    requirements for linkages across LA borders as well as across public
    service providers. Open standards are therefore felt to be an
    important principle.

-   A number of LAs are keen to take up opportunities to share knowledge
    and experience as well as to collaborate in constructive ways
    especially with the Government Digital Service (GDS).

-   Most frequently identified benefits of implementing a standardised
    online citizen IdA solution include greater satisfaction, security
    and convenience for the citizen and improved efficiency and lower
    costs for the LA.

-   Most frequently identified barriers and issues include
    organizational silos, cost (although this was not explicitly
    identified as a resource issue), data matching and quality, citizen
    trust, ownership (of data and/or service), legal understanding and
    accessibility and usability of a solution.

-   LAs are interested to identify whether, how and when their plans may
    align with a national approach and to minimize any risk of future
    isolation and/or having to re-engineer their chosen solution.

The following recommendations are made:

1.  Provide assistance to LAs so that they may align with the IdAP
    vision:

    -   Publish IdAP vision and strategy at earliest opportunity

    -   Publish IdAP deliverables roadmap and timeline

    -   Enable LAs to utilise the HMG procurement framework.

2.  Work nationally with all suppliers including LA suppliers to:

    -   Review the landscape of IdA provision

    -   Promote the national perspective.

3.  Publish a common set of features & standards for IdA (such as a
    minimum feature list). These would build on good practice guides
    such as the Requirements for Secure Delivery of Online Public
    Services (RSDOPS).

4.  Engage with LAs to pilot federated IdA solutions and explore
    alternative non-federated approaches that have already been taken by
    some LAs such as Harrow to online citizen IdA.

5.  Widen lines of communications to LAs through:

    -   Knowledge sharing platform

    -   Newsletters

    -   Social media (e.g. blogs, tweets).

6.  Develop good practice guidelines for implementing assisted digital
    for IdA.

7.  Customer insight research is required to:

    -   Investigate user attitudes to and perceptions of trust, data sharing
        and the role of 3rd party identity providers

    -   Usability/accessibility studies should be undertaken and good
        practice for IdA defined and published

    -   Develop a communications plan and national campaign to raise citizen
        awareness and trust.

8.  Create a national brand for federated IdA to encourage citizens to
    trust the new approach.
