##03 Review Approach

###Local Authority Representation


A small sample of LAs was selected for participation in a review of
current local IdA practices and intentions for the future.

In order to explore whether functional differences would result in any
dissimilarity in provision or needs, both one and two tier authorities
were included. Geographic location, size and type were also considered
so that representation from metropolitan, city, county, district and
borough councils across the country was also sought. Appendix A provides
a summary list of participants and authorities.

###Methodology

Senior LA figures were engaged to take part in phone based interviews
during the month of August 2012. In total 16 interviews were held with
senior officers from both business and ICT departments.

Thirteen of the semi-structured interviews were based around a series of
topics designed to explore online services being offered to citizens and
requirements for IdA in relation to those services. Three additional
interviews were undertaken to gain further opinions on anticipated
citizen attitudes towards federated online IdA provision.

Telephone interviews generally took between 30 and sixty minutes and
were recorded to ensure accurate analysis of content.
