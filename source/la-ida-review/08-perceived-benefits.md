Benefits were generally qualitative in nature although efficiency
improvements and cost reductions should both be quantifiably measurable
beneficial outcomes.

Although this is an aspect about which thoughts are still developing,
some suggestions for measuring the benefits of online citizen IdA
include monitoring the take-up of services that fall within the umbrella
of the IdA mechanism and monitoring customer satisfaction levels.

Responsibility for managing benefits has largely still to be defined but
it was generally felt to lie within the remit of the service owner, the
customer services group or the CIO group.
