Success isn’t easy, says Tim Brooks, a member of the government's [Digital Advisory Board](http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/2012/04/25/introducing-the-digital-advisory-board/).

*“I don't think it’s magic. Success comes from a lot of hard work and argument and pain along the way.”*

Now the Chief Executive of BMJ Group, Tim has spent his whole life working in the media business. He’s seen digital technologies undermine, then completely revolutionise the way media products are created, sold, and distributed. He’s had first-hand experience of the hard work and the pain found on the path to success.

He’s particularly keen to see government opening its doors to small and medium sized companies, allowing them to supply services that, to date, have been the sole domain of huge technology corporations with huge budgets. 

Big doesn’t necessarily mean being best. In the past, says Tim, it’s been almost impossible for anyone other than those big companies to deal with government. In today’s climate, that’s a disadvantage for everyone.

*“The reality is that it’s often the smaller companies, companies with just 20 people or so, who are driving change and being innovative. They’re inventing new services and taking costs out of services.”*

If the government can tap into that pool of innovation and ideas, the whole nation will benefit.

*“It will unleash a lot of creativity. Often the way to solve these problems quickly and effectively is to find small ways to solve them.”*

The Government Digital Strategy is necessary, he says, because governments in recent years simply haven’t kept up with the speed at which technology changes.

*“Government has got way behind the rest of the country. It’s a cliché, but it’s true: you can book a flight in two minutes on your mobile phone, but dealing with government often requires lots of paperwork. It’s time government services caught up.”*
