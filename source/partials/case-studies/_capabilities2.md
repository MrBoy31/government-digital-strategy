The Government Digital Strategy says departments need to have *“appropriate digital capability in-house.”* 

What does that mean? It means hiring people like Mat Wall, Chris Heathcote, and Anna Shipman.

They’re just 3 of the many technical experts working for Government Digital Service, putting their knowledge about the potential of the internet to work in transforming services.

They are 3 very different individuals, united by a passion for public service, smart technology, and something creative lead Chris describes like this: *“We all just want to make good things.”*

Understanding how people interact with computers is a subtle, challenging art

Among many things technical architect Mat does are writing code and testing prototypes on the people who will eventually end up using the finished product.

*“We need to understand how people interact with computers. That’s quite a subtle, challenging art.”*

Redesigned digital services are put in front of fresh eyes. Mat and his colleagues watch closely to see how people react.

*“That’s usually when you find out that everything you thought you knew was wrong,”* he says wryly. That doesn’t equal failure, though: it’s just another step along the journey to something that does work, and is a success.

All 3 use something called ['agile'](http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/2011/05/13/agile-does-work-in-government/), a way of working that’s deeply embedded into everything that Government Digital Service does.

Software developer Anna says agile is better because *“you get a better feedback loop.”* New ideas are built fast, tested by real users, then refined and re-built to make improvements.

Mat says: *“Agile is 2 questions: what do you want by Friday? And how can we make it better than last week?”*

*“There needs to be a change in the way people look at risk,”* adds Chris. *“You don’t always know what you’re going to get in the end. But you end up with something cheaper and quicker if you use Agile.”*

Agile is - what do you want by Friday? And how can we make it better than last week?

All of them relish the buzzy and upbeat atmosphere at Government Digital Service.

Mat describes the place as *“very dynamic. It’s actually quite a well-orchestrated dance.”*

And Anna is in no doubt that she has found the right place to work:

*"This is the best job I’ve ever had. I’m working with some amazing, inspirational people. We’re doing something I feel is worthwhile. It’s absolutely brilliant.”*
