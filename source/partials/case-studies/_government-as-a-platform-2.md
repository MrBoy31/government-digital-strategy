According to Tim O’Reilly *‘government needs to start thinking about itself as a platform’*. And Tim’s opinion matters, as the founder and CEO of O'Reilly Media - one of the world’s most respected computer book publishers.

Tim believes that government is right in wanting to create service end points that will allow outside developers to build applications against its data. Why? *“Because it enables you build web services rather than just websites and apps, and when you publish those end points it enables people to use government data in a way that nobody expected”*. For Tim, *“that’s when you get that incredible revolution”*.

He gives an example of how Apple rethought the mobile phone, with companies going from sitting down with a couple of developers and coming up with 30 applications for a phone, to Apple creating a platform which has resulted in more than 700,000 applications being created for the iPhone.

Tim believes that the real mark of success for government will be when government establishes the baseline set of things that it absolutely needs to do and then exposes a robust, rich set of service end points that will let people in the private sector add value to that minimal “must do” set.

*“Then we can hit some real magic because we will get more and more service for citizens with more and more ingenuity, without any procurement at all because the government made it possible for people outside to build interesting things.”*

Tim finishes with an enlightening story that has stuck with him. It is an old story of the first two British shoe salesmen that went to Africa. The first thought there was no opportunity because nobody in Africa wore shoes. The second, however, wrote home saying ‘send more people, nobody wears shoes’! For Tim, the latter is the entrepreneurial attitude that the government should be, and is, adopting.
