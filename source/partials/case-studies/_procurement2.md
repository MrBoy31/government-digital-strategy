Traditionally, government buys IT services from very large suppliers (known as system integrators, or SIs), often under long-term contracts costing many millions of pounds, via a slow and cumbersome procurement process.

*"We know we're not getting value for money - recently a big SI and an SME bid on the Cloudstore for hosting. The SI bid £4 million. The SME bid £50,000,"* said Minister for the Cabinet Office, Francis Maude, in a speech in November 2012.

Traditional procurement practices have to be swept aside, says Denise McDonagh, Director of Home Office IT Strategy and Programme Director for G-Cloud and the online CloudStore.

CloudStore is a radically different approach for buying government IT. It’s a quick, easy and low-cost way for public sector organisations to get the IT services they need, when they need them.

Cloudstore lets small companies do business with government. It widens the marketplace

*“The pace of technological change is much faster than it used to be,”* says Denise. *“We have to be able to keep up with it.”*

One aim is to make it possible for a much wider variety of small and medium-sized companies to supply IT services to government and the wider pubic sector, so they can compete against the big names that have done it in the past. CloudStore removes barriers that made it hard for those smaller businesses to compete.

*“CloudStore is one of the first programmes to let small companies do business with the public sector in a way that’s not too costly for them. It widens the marketplace,”* says Denise. CloudStore sticks to the rules of traditional procurement, and meets all the requirements of national and EU legislation. But it does so in a new and innovative way.
So all a public sector buyer needs to do is search on what they want and then buy it. It’s simple, legal and efficient.

The result is an online store of services, priced up and ready to go. A sort of technology supermarket that Denise compares to an app store you might find on your mobile phone.

It’s a complete transformation, says Denise. *“Now we have access to services that are easy to use and easy to turn off when we no longer need them. And they can be as cheap as chips.”*

For example, in 2012 the Home Office needed a text messaging service for the duration of the Olympic Games. 

*“If I’d gone to an SI for that, it would have cost me a fortune. But in the end I paid less than £5,000, bought it in a couple of days, deployed it very quickly, and switched it off just like that at the end.*

*“This is a different way of thinking. It’s about challenging the status quo.”*
