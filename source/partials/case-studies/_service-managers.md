The Government Digital Strategy sets out an ambitious programme of change across government, but some departments have already started making those changes. The key to success, they have discovered, is ensuring that new digital services are designed and run by managers who have a keen sense of connection with the people who use them.

Managers like Nikki Marsh and Carolyn Williams.

Nikki is head of digital services at the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP), working on new ways to distribute benefits such as Carer’s Allowance. Understanding from the outset what the people using those services really need is crucial for building good online versions, she says.

*“Your number one consideration is that you’re dealing with a user experience, not a process,”* she says. 

She describes how sometimes the organisation has inadvertently defaulted to wondering *"why aren't our customers doing what we expected or asked them to do on this new website"*?  Her response to that was *"Why? It's because sometimes we are asking them to do something that isn't natural behaviour to them - or maybe because we have said it in ways that are clearly understood by departmental staff, but not by people outside"*.

On the web, people just want to get the job done. Quick and simple.

The solution? To start with the natural, obvious way of doing things, and build web services that match that.

An example of a very successful web service is Electronic Vehicle Licencing (EVL), created by the Driver and Vehicle Licencing Agency (DVLA). Carolyn is their head of electronic services, and speaks with pride about EVL’s success to date. Millions of car owners use it because it’s quick and simple. It saves them time. 

*“Customers want to come in, use the service, and get out again,” she says. “You have to take responsibility for that.”*

Carolyn is always looking for ways to make things work even better. When she discovered that thousands of people were not using EVL because the online form asked for their car’s mileage, she campaigned for that question to be removed.

*“It’s a simple thing, but people were stopping at that point because that question meant they had to get up from their computer and go and look inside their car.”*

The lesson was learned: people don’t want to be interrupted when filling out forms on the web. They want to settle down and get the job done. Quick and simple. The question was dropped.

*“Knowing your customers is the most important thing you can do,”* says Carolyn.

The work of people like Nikki and Carolyn will be critical to the success of the Government Digital Strategy in the years to come. As the Digital Strategy is rolled out, all departments will be making sure they have similar Service Managers who understand both the customers they serve and the ways digital technology can be put to use in serving them.

Despite their success to date, neither is content to stand still. 

Nikki puts it simply: *“It’s not always about chasing the next shiny new thing. We have to keep asking ourselves: what have we learned from what we’ve already done? How can we make things as good as they can be?”*
