After over two decades in the media business, Mediacom’s Chief Strategy Officer Sue Unerman knows a thing or two about digital transformation.

She’s a member of the [Digital Advisory Board](http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/2012/04/25/introducing-the-digital-advisory-board/), helping the government understand the digital landscape as well as the private companies that have been wrestling with it for years. 

Through her work with all sorts of clients large and small, she’s learned that it’s important to make sure every individual in an organisation is following the same path. There are some who live digital lives already, and others who don’t. Getting both sides to meet and understand each other is vital for success.

Digital... is the biggest single thing transforming our lives

*“It’s about how to make things seamless and integrate teams of people. Not just a set of specialists who know everything and a set of generalists who reject the changes - it's bringing advice about integrating those two sets of people into one team with a single focus,”* she says.

Developing and nurturing digital capability at all levels in the civil service - from the most senior leaders through to frontline staff - is one of the most important tasks facing the government as it implements the [Civil Service Reform Plan](http://www.civilservice.gov.uk/reform) and its digital strategy in the years ahead.  The nation’s most successful businesses have already gone through all this, they’ve discovered what works and what doesn’t. That’s why it’s so useful to have their expertise on the Advisory Board.

Radical change works best when the people at the top who are demanding the change understand that the people working for them, lower down the organisation, might have expert knowledge about the issues involved and the way that digital can be used to best effect, says Sue. Rather than imposing change from the top down, it needs to become a two-way conversation.

*“The secret, the way to unlock it, was to get people talking to each other. You get exchange that leads to real change and everybody embracing it.”*

Sue has no doubts about the importance of the Digital Strategy to the nation’s future success.

*“The Digital Strategy matters because it's the biggest single thing that's transforming our lives that we've seen in our lifetimes,”* says Sue. Delivering that transformation in an inclusive way, a way that caters for all levels of digital participation, is also essential, she says.

*“Consumers are at very different levels, with how they're dealing with digital. Some take to it like a duck to water, and you have the teenagers who are digital natives who are growing up with it. Then there are others who find it all very difficult to grasp.* 

*“This project matters because it has such huge efficiencies and power in it, but it needs to be delivered in a way that doesn't put people off, that people don't find frightening, so that everyone can use it in the best possible way. If we can achieve that, we arrive at a new Britain.”*
