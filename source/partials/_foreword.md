In just over 2 decades the internet has become a huge part of our everyday lives.
Today 82% of adults in the UK are online. Completing transactions online has become second
nature, with more and more of us going online for shopping, banking, information and
entertainment. Why? Because online services tend to be quicker, more convenient and
cheaper to use.

But until now government services have stood out by their failure to keep up with the
digital age. While many sectors now deliver their services online as a matter of course,
our use of digital public services lags far behind that of the private sector. For example
while 74% of people use the internet for car insurance, only 51% renew car tax online.

Government has got to do better. This Digital Efficiency Report suggests that
transactions online can already be 20 times cheaper than by phone, 30 times
cheaper than postal, and as much as 50 times cheaper than face-to-face .

By going digital by default, the government could save between £1.7 and £1.8 billion each
year.

But this isn't just about saving money - the public increasingly expects to access
services quickly and conveniently, at times and in ways that suit them. We will not leave
anyone behind but we will use digital technology to drive better services and lower
costs.

We will also need to embed digital skills into our organisational DNA, developing a
culture that puts people's needs first so we plan and design our services around what
users need to get done, not around the ways government want them to do it.

This Government Digital Strategy is just the start of a process that will transform how we provide
services. Departments will be publishing their own digital strategies later this year,
setting out how they will improve their services and reduce costs. New technology also
means that for the first time individuals, entrepreneurs and businesses can now access
and exploit public data in a way that increases accountability, drives choice and spurs
innovation. Government will continue to be on the forefront of the open data revolution
– putting more and more data in the public domain that will underpin new social and
economic growth.

Until now government has been slow to realise the benefits of the digital age. In the
future our services will be fit for the 21st Century – agile, flexible and digital by default.
