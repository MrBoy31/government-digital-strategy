Work is underway to identify the key legislative barriers to digital service development at Home Office – the key barriers are identified in this strategy, and they are barriers that are also faced by other departments. The speed at which these legislative blockers can be addressed will influence the speed at which we are able to achieve truly digital by default services.

MoJ will identify and remove legislative barriers to digitising services. In practice this could mean reviewing current restrictive interpretations of laws or amending legislation that prevents us from developing straightforward, convenient digital services. As legislation can take time to change, in the interim we will get on with delivering partial digital solutions, but always with a view to realising the full potential for digitisation later.
