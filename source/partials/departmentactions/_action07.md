DCMS has participated fully up to the launch of GOV.UK. We do not offer transactional services, so have little content on the citizen- and business-facing sections, but are on schedule to transfer our content to Inside Government in March 2013. The nature of our arm's length bodies means they fall within exempt categories – though we will look to work with them on digital developments.
