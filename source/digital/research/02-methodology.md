##02 Methodology

2CV carried out a quantitative study on how UK adults use the internet, and how they access government information and transactional services online. The researchers conducted interviews with 1,298 adults, ensuring that it was nationally representative and weighting it according to ONS Internet Use data.

Of the interviewees, 990 were recruited online, and these people took part in online interviews. The remaining 308 interviewees are people who are offline, and they took part in face-to-face interviews.

2CV also carried out a qualitative study with people who don’t use government information and transactional services online. These consisted of 18 2-hour ethnography sessions with pre- and post-session tasks. 

These sessions included people of a range of ages, people who are employed and unemployed, people with disabilities, people from lower socio-economic groups, and people living in both rural and urban areas. This informed <a href="#groupings-of-people-who-do-not-use-government-services-or-information-online">2CV’s groupings of non-users of government digital services</a>.

###A note on weighting

2CV weighted the data from these interviews to reflect the population as a whole. In the case of this research, it meant the data from the 76% of our interviewees who are online was ‘upweighted’ to reflect the fact that, according to ONS data, 82% of the actual population is online. This is why, in the research that follows, you will see references to the 1,064 online users and 234 users who are offline who have taken part in this survey.
