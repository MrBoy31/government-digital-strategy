##03 About assisted digital

####The need

{include assisteddigital/theneed-panel.md}

Assisted digital is the help government will give to ensure that we do not exclude any users of government services (whether citizens or businesses) who are not online. The [Digital Landscape Research](/digital/research/) shows that 18% of UK adults are offline (defined as rarely or never being online). 82% of people are online (defined as regularly or occasionally using the internet) but some have lower digital skills and may need help, at least initially, to use digital services.

Assisted digital provision will vary from service to service and will be developed based on the needs of users, not based on the way government is organised. Users will need less assistance with simpler services and more with complex services. Some services will have more people who require assistance than others. For example, government-to-business services may need less support than government-to-consumer services that serve a user group with lower levels of digital skills.

Many customers for government transactions are in rural areas,[^3] 
where almost a quarter of households have access to no or slow broadband.[^4] For those households, the government’s roll-out of superfast broadband over the next few years will be the crucial enabler for going digital. It is recognised that assisted digital support will be particularly important for those currently without broadband infrastructure.


####Moving from multiple channels to Digital by Default

Digital by Default involves encouraging everyone who can use digital services independently to do so, as we committed to in [Action 8](/digital/strategy/#action-08) of the Government Digital Strategy. As we move to digital by default service delivery, the only non-digital ways to access services will be the assisted digital support for the people who really need it. They will be able to access a service face to face, by phone, or in another appropriate non-digital way, with someone either inputting the data on their behalf, or helping them put their data into the digital service themselves.[^5] 
We will close existing alternative channels as the demand for non-digital services decreases.


####Achieving efficiencies

The [Digital Efficiency Report](/digital/efficiency/) estimates that moving services from offline to digital channels will save between £1.7 billion and £1.8 billion each year. Currently government spends an estimated £4 billion each year on providing non-digital transactions which, in future, will be thought of as assisted digital transactions. Targeting assisted digital provision at the people who really need it, and encouraging everyone who can independently use a digital service to ‘self-serve’, could potentially reduce the cost of providing non-digital contact to £1.3 billion each year.[^6] 
These reductions are part of the potential efficiencies from the move to digital by default set out in the [Digital Efficiency Report](/digital/efficiency/).[^7] They are early estimates of the volume and cost of future assisted digital provision and will be revised as services become digital by default.

To achieve these savings, we must close existing alternative channels as the demand for non-digital services decreases. Where an alternative channel remains, it must be recalibrated to provide assisted digital support. There will be a strong presumption towards procuring external resource to provide assisted digital support, from the private sector, the voluntary sector, and other parts of the public sector. In exceptional circumstances, departments may seek an exemption from this requirement; for example, where a business case for external provision does not demonstrate good value for money. Any cases put forward would be agreed at a cross-government level.  Transitioning from in-house to external provision will be phased in as the marketplace of assisted digital providers is established.

There is potential for further efficiency savings in assisted digital through the application of new technologies, innovative arrangements with external providers and intermediaries, and departments working jointly to procure assisted digital support. We will explore these opportunities as we pursue the actions contained in this document.


####What good looks like

{include assisteddigital/innovation-panel.md}

Good assisted digital support provides another way into a digital service for people who need it and is designed to meet their needs. The user may deal with the service face-to-face, on the telephone, or in another way, but their information will be fed into the digital service by the person or technology they are interacting with. Sometimes, assisted digital users will interact with the service digitally in a way that is accessible and appropriate, for example, by using the service with an intermediary who helps them use a digital interface, whether in person or remotely.

We need to make assisted digital provision consistent for users. Most users access a number of central government services, and many use both citizen and business facing services. The support we provide across these services must meet their needs and they must know how and where to access it.

Good assisted digital provision will use and build on existing methods for delivering assistance to people accessing services in their local area, including the support provided in libraries for people to use the internet.

This document does not specifically cover ways to increase the digital capability of UK citizens, but good assisted digital provision might also encourage and equip people to use the digital service independently in future. In designing assisted digital services, we will look at whether these can incorporate an element of learning, trialling a number of approaches, and wider discussions are ongoing between Digital Leaders across government around the issue of digital inclusion.

Government can make further contributions to assisted digital users through corporate social responsibility activity. For example, the Driver and Vehicle Licencing Agency (DVLA) recently held Silver Surfers events at their offices and the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) have a Digital Champion in every Jobcentre Plus. Providers of assisted digital support can also direct people who are offline to places where they can get support to get online.
