##04 The approach

####The role of departments

Departments will commission and fund assisted digital support and the Government Digital Service will play a coordinating role. 

As redesigned digital services are introduced and more users access services digitally, existing non-digital channels will be closed and new types of support will be procured as required.

The 23 exemplar services cover a range of assisted digital requirements for citizens and businesses. From these 23 services, we will develop models of assisted digital provision that can be reused by other services.

Local procurement and delivery may be the best way to make sure that assisted digital meets users needs, which may be different in different places. This will include working with the devolved administrations.

Although we expect assisted digital provision to vary, services do tend to naturally cluster into particular types, and we will agree common models of assisted digital delivery to ensure consistency for the user and efficiency for government. For example, the assisted digital provision may be clustered depending on the type of service (for example, booking an appointment or making a payment) or the audience (for example, older people). When these models have been developed and agreed, departments will follow them except where there is an exceptional need not to (which will be agreed through the Assisted Digital Programme Board - see [Programme and governance](#programme-and-governance)).

Departments will:

- ensure that digital by default services include appropriate assisted digital support, and that this will be in place when the services become digital by default
- select and manage the delivery of assisted digital provision for all services through the most appropriate routes
- agree and follow common models of assisted digital support

Government Digital Service will:

- work with departments on the 23 exemplar services that are being redesigned to scope the assisted digital provision and ensure consistency across services
- support the development of assisted digital models that can be transferred from the first 23 services to subsequent redesigned services


####Programme and governance

The Government Digital Service will set up an assisted digital programme team and operate the governance structures to ensure coordination and collaboration across government.

The programme will be governed collaboratively by a cross-departmental board, reporting to Departmental Digital Leaders. The board will oversee implementation of the workstreams contained in this strategy and maintain oversight of the agreed shared models of assisted digital and collaborative procurement, including approving exemption requests from departments to provide assisted digital outside the common models or shared procurement routes.

The board will consist of representatives from the seven [main transactional departments](/strategy/#developing-digital-transactions) plus others on a rotating basis. The board will also engage with a stakeholder reference group made up of organisations who work with and represent people who are offline or who have lower digital capability. GDS will also work with Go ON UK to define and promote effective assisted digital support and share best practice across sectors. Go ON UK will also explore with GDS and partners whether an assisted digital standard or kitemark would be of benefit to the general public and relevant service providers.

Government Digital Service will:

- establish and provide the secretariat for the programme board and the stakeholder reference group

The programme board will:

- make collective decisions on the governmentâ€™s approach to assisted digital, including on exemption requests from collaborative procurement and agreed shared models of assisted digital
- operate from January 2013


####Procuring assisted digital support

As the default, assisted digital support will be provided through the private sector, wider public sector providers such as libraries or local government, and the voluntary and community sector. We will only consider in-house provision by the civil service in exceptional circumstances; for example, where a business case for external provision does not demonstrate good value for money.  Any cases put forward would be agreed at a cross-government level.

Rather than traditional procurement methods, some services may use intermediaries to deliver assisted digital or partner with providers to build the provision of assisted digital into their existing services. Equally, other private sector or voluntary and community sector organisations may wish to provide similar services, either free of charge or at cost to the user.

Departments will:

-   provide assisted digital support through external providers as the default
-   work together to collaboratively procure services from commercial, wider public sector and volunteer providers

Government Digital Service will:

-   work with departments to collaboratively engage the market


####Trialling new ways of working

We will trial new ways to deliver services to people who cannot use digital services independently and how we can best work with the market (see [Procuring assisted digital support](#procuring-assisted-digital-support)). Civil servants, the wider public sector, external providers and people and organisations working with citizens who are offline or who have lower digital capability can all contribute to the central government approach to assisted digital support.

Departments will:

-   develop and trial new ways of delivering assisted digital support to users of the 23 exemplar services, including engaging with potential commercial, public sector and voluntary sector providers

Government Digital Service will:

-   run an open policy making exercise in early 2013 to gather innovative ideas for assisted digital provision


####Developing a service standard

We will develop and agree an assisted digital service standard, as part of the digital by default service standard committed to in the [Government Digital Strategy](/digital/strategy/#action-06).

The service standard will ensure that each service that goes through a digital transformation and goes live on [GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/) will have good quality assisted digital support that is designed to meet the needs of users.

The standard will contain a set of principles for what good assisted digital looks like. It will include guidance on how to monitor assisted digital provision, to ensure that assisted digital is only provided to the people who really need it and others are encouraged to use digital services independently. No new or redesigned service will go live unless they meet this standard.

Departments will:

-   work with the Government Digital Service to develop the standard and principles of good assisted digital provision, and ensure that, from April 2014, all new or redesigned transactional services will meet the digital by default service standard

Government Digital Service will:

- manage the development of the service standard and provide support, guidance and tools that help service teams meet the standard throughout the development and life of the service
- publish the standard by April 2013


####Considering the case for a quality mark

Users frequently access more than one central government service. Therefore, those who use assisted digital support will need a way to identify where they will find approved assisted digital provision.

When sensitive information is being handled, users will need assurance that their information will be handled securely, especially if new providers who they are not familiar with are delivering the assistance. Our working assumption is that a quality mark of approved assisted digital provision will be required. This quality standard may be operated by an organisation independent of government.

Departments and Government Digital Service will:

-   work together to assess the need for a quality mark and develop one if required
-   develop final proposals by the end of 2013
