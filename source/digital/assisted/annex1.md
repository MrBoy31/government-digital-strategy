##Annex - Examples of assisted digital provision

The examples below demonstrate the move from the current state of multi-channel service delivery to digital by default with assisted digital support. The examples show this for different customer needs and different types of service. Please note these are notional examples designed for illustration only.

####1. Service A

This service is a licence request for citizens. Many users are younger and from higher socio-economic groups, and the overall user group has a level of digital capability that broadly matches the whole population.[^8] The service has a medium level of complexity and does not require a payment.

The service is expected to reach 80% digital uptake once it becomes digital by default. Assisted digital users will be able to access the service via intermediaries. Some of these intermediaries will be funded by government but others choose to provide it voluntarily as part of their broader service offerings.

####2. Service B

This service allows citizens to request benefits. Users are unemployed and tend to be from lower socio-economic groups. The overall user group has a level of digital capability that is lower than the whole population.The service has a high level of complexity.

The service is expected to reach 50% digital uptake once it becomes digital by default. There will be two routes for assisted digital users to access the service, face to face and with a remote contact centre agent. Both routes will help the assisted digital user through the digital transaction as the first option, rather than complete it on their behalf.

Currently, 84% of users are using the non-digital channel but only 50% will need assisted digital provision when we move to digital by default. Consequently, 34% of users are currently using the non-digital channel, but could be using digital.

####3. Service C

This service is for large, medium and small businesses to report information to government. The overall user group has a level of digital capability that broadly matches the whole population of businesses.

The service is expected to reach 85% digital uptake once it becomes digital by default. Assisted digital support will be provided by an outsourced contact centre which supports multiple business services.

Currently, 23% of users are using the non-digital channel but only 15% will need assisted digital provision when we move to digital by default. Consequently, 8% of users are currently using the non-digital channel, but could be using digital.
