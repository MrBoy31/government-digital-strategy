##02 Introduction

This document explains how we will support people who are not online to access one or more of the 650+ central government transactional services.

Moving to digital by default means that, over time, government will provide digital services so straightforward and convenient that all those who can use them will choose to do so, whilst those who can’t are not excluded.  All services with over 100,000 transactions a year will be redesigned to become digital services ([Action 5](/digital/strategy/#action-05) of the Government Digital Strategy).

As government becomes digital by default, we recognise that some people are offline and others, whilst online, have limited digital capability. We recognise that not everyone will be able to use digital communications, information and services independently, and that the needs of people who are offline should be considered throughout a digital by default approach.

This document fulfils [Action 9](/digital/strategy/#action-09) of the Government Digital Strategy which made a commitment to a government approach to assisted digital for central government transactions. It supports the reforms to policy making and service delivery outlined in the [Civil Service Reform Plan](http://www.civilservice.gov.uk/reform) and [Open Public Services](http://www.openpublicservices.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/) white paper. [Departmental digital strategies](/digital/#departmental-strategies) also reflect the commitment to take a cross-government approach to assisted digital. 

This document commits government to a number of actions through which we will develop and take a consistent approach to assisted digital. Assisted digital provision will vary for different users and for different services, so the document is not intended to provide a single answer to how this help is provided. Its purpose is to provide a shared approach to ensure that assisted digital provision is co-ordinated and appropriate for users and efficient for government. We will further refine this approach through transforming the 23 exemplar assisted digital services.

This approach has been developed with departments and with input from organisations representing and working with people who can’t use digital services (including Age UK, Post Office, Online Centres Foundation, Citizens Advice, Go ON UK, Society of Chief Librarians, Digital Unite, Communications Consumer Panel, Carers UK, UCanDoIT, Shelter, Shaw Trust and Lasa and, within government, Arts Council England and BDUK).

The document concentrates on support for users of services in the UK.  We recognise that some users outside the UK will need support, for example British nationals overseas.  We will continue to work with relevant departments on this.
