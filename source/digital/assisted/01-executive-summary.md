The [Government Digital Strategy](/digital/strategy/) set out how government will become digital by default. By digital by
default, we mean creating digital services that are so straightforward
and convenient that all those who can use them will choose to do so
whilst those who can’t are not excluded.

23 major services will become digital by default by March 2015 - more details on these can be found in [departmental digital strategies](/digital/#departmental-strategies) - and all services with over 100,000 transactions each year will be redesigned ([Action 5](/digital/strategy/#action-05) of the Government Digital Strategy).

Everyone who can use digital services independently will be encouraged to do so ([Action 8](/digital/strategy/#action-08) of the Government Digital Strategy), and the [18% of people who are offline](/digital/research/#fig-1) will use assisted digital support ([Action 9](/digital/strategy/#action-09) of the Government Digital Strategy).

People who need this support will be able to access a service face to face, by phone, or in another appropriate non-digital way, with someone either inputting their data into the digital system on their behalf, or helping them put their data into the digital service themselves.

There are over 650 transactional services available for people and businesses. Government spends an estimated £4 billion each year on providing non-digital transactions, generally allowing users to access alternative channels (eg. face to face, telephone or post) at will.  We will reduce these costs, potentially down to £1.3 billion each year,[^1] by encouraging everyone who is online to use the digital service independently, 
and developing targeted assisted digital provision for the people who really need it.[^2] 
This reduction is part of the potential efficiencies from the move to digital by default set out in the [Digital Efficiency Report](/digital/efficiency/).

To realise these savings, we must close existing alternative channels as the demand for non-digital services decreases.  Where an alternative channel remains, it must be recalibrated to provide assisted digital support. There will be a strong presumption towards procuring external resource to provide assisted digital support, from the private sector, the voluntary sector, and other parts of the public sector.  In exceptional circumstances, departments may seek an exemption from this requirement; for example, where a business case for external provision does not demonstrate good value for money. Transitioning from in-house to external provision will be phased in as the marketplace of assisted digital providers is established.

This document does not specifically cover ways to increase the digital capability of UK citizens - commonly known as Digital Inclusion activities - but discussions are ongoing between Digital Leaders across government around the issue of digital inclusion.  In designing assisted digital services, we will look at whether these can incorporate an element of learning so that people are encouraged to self-serve in future.

We will:

-   Work with the private sector, voluntary sector and other parts of the public sector to provide assisted digital support
-   Try new ways of working to provide assisted digital support efficiently and effectively
-   Introduce a service standard, so assisted digital support is of consistently high quality
-   Consider introducing a quality mark for approved/accredited providers so users can be confident in the support they will receive
-   Work with organisations representing and working with assisted digital users through a stakeholder reference group to help us design support that meets the needs of users
-   Set up a programme board and make collective decisions, to make sure that government departments work together and take a consistent approach.
