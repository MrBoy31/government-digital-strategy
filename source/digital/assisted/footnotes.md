[^1]: This figure is an early estimate of the cost of future assisted digital provision and will be revised as services become digital by default. Note that the potential saving from reducing non-digital contact is not equal to the total potential saving suggested in the [Digital Efficiency Report](/digital/efficiency/). This is due to the increased use of digital channels.

[^2]: When services have become digital by default, we expect levels of digital usage to increase, with assisted digital requirements correspondingly reducing. On average, a typical service with mainstream users is expected to reach 80% digital take-up, based on previous case studies of digital transformation, leaving 20% requiring assisted digital provision. A typical service with less digitally capable users is expected to have a 50% digital take-up, and this is a very conservative estimate. At least 85% of businesses would be expected to be online and able to use these services without support, again based on previous case studies of digital transformation. If services are not simple and straightforward enough, then more users will need assisted digital support and, as this support is more expensive than digital self-service, there is a need to ensure services can be used by everyone who is online.

	currently need to be done offline and may still need to be done offline
	in future by all users, regardless of their digital capability (e.g.
	providing wet signatures, providing original documents and collecting
	biometric data).
