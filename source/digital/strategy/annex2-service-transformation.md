##Annex 2 - Service transformation

###Government Digital Service transformation team

The transformation team works with departments, agencies, non-departmental public bodies and arms length bodies
on their digital transformation projects. It helps
establish what departments do, who departments do it for, legacy
challenges, in-house digital capability, and savings opportunities
from channel shift and technology replacement. It supports them using either a co-delivery or consultancy model.

The main objective is to provide user-focused, cost effective and
maintainable digital services.

###Deliverables

-   implementation of controls and governance for digital
    transformation projects
-   assessment and approval of departmental digital projects
-   detailed feasibility and direction-setting
-   building and supporting departments digital capability
-   establishing a new government supplier chain for digital services
    using small and medium sized enterprises
-   managing delivery and benefits realisation

###Governance and controls

-   Government Digital Service operates a set of controls for Cabinet Office to control spend
    on digital projects and initiatives
-   these are managed in conjunction with departments through the
    Digital Leader Network
-   propositions are formally submitted to and reviewed by the
    transformation team, with collaboration from the submitting
    department
-   two formal boards control the approval of recommended approaches,
    spend control exercise and Efficiency and Reform Group wider approval with IT Reform Group and
    Commercial Models Team
-   all propositions must deliver user value and financial savings

###Assessment criteria

Departmental propositions are assessed at different stages of the process
but a common theme runs throughout:

-   what is the department trying to do?
-   who are they doing it for?
-   what is the investment and savings opportunity?
-   what constraints do we face (people/process/technology)?
-   how will we measure success?
-   what factors are critical to success?

Given the above, a recommendation is put forward.

Departments are encouraged to use the same assessment criteria during
their own service proposition (portfolio) management process.

An example of an existing departmental proposition management process
is given below.
