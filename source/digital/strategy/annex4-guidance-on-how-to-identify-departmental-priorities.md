##Annex 4 - Guidance on how to identify departmental priorities

Departments will be responsible for how they plan the redesign of their services.

Departmental decisions on priorities for determining the order that
services come forward for end-to-end redesign will therefore vary
according to circumstances and opportunities, but prioritisation could
be based on any of the following:

-   high volume, high impact processes where improvements will benefit
    a lot of users rapidly
-   quick wins, where there is opportunity to do a short sharp piece
    of work to transform a service (or important aspects of it)
-   services where a high proportion of potential users are already
    online, providing opportunities to achieve high digital take-up
    rapidly
-   breaks in contract provision, where a change offers an opportunity
    for a re-appraisal of what is delivered and how
-   a service currently perceived as problematic or ‘failing’, where a
    transformational redesign will reduce user frustration or
    operational inefficiencies resulting in savings
-   ‘greenfield’ opportunities to introduce new digital services
-   opportunities or inter-dependencies within or between departments
    to provide more holistic and connected services to users (Digital
    Leaders and Government Digital Service will actively look for such
    opportunities as plans are drawn up)
