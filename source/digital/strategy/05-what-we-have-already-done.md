##05 What we have already done

Government’s online information services are closer to becoming users’
preferred (default) option than its transactional services.

Government online publishing is in the process of being transformed by
the GOV.UK programme, a radical simplification of government web
publishing started in 2011 in response to [Martha Lane Fox’s review](http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/resource-library/directgov-2010-and-beyond-revolution-not-evolution). The
GOV.UK website (which replaced the previous Directgov and Businesslink.gov.uk
sites in October 2012 in providing government information for citizens
and businesses) has already demonstrated that it is simpler, clearer and
faster for users.

Government already uses digital channels for most of its communications,
marketing and engagement. Most departments and many agencies have
developed expertise in using social media and other third-party digital
properties such as YouTube to communicate with people and businesses,
rather than paying for other channels. [The Red Tape
Challenge](http://www.redtapechallenge.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/home/index/)
and [e-petitions](http://epetitions.direct.gov.uk/) are 2 examples of
this approach.

Government has also made some progress in providing convenient,
well-used and well regarded transactional digital services. For example,
digital is the preferred channel for most users of Companies House, with
an [89% online take-up of annual returns search and filing](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/media/261356/channel_strategy_cases.pdf) achieved in
just 5 years, and for HMRC’s Self Assessment tax service where a
record [80% of returns were filed online in 2011/12](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/about/business-plan-2012.pdf).

Progress is also being made in making government information and
transactions more widely and conveniently available through third
parties. [Over two thirds of the 7.65 million Self Assessment
transactions received online by HMRC are submitted via third-party
software and service providers](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/about/business-plan-2012.pdf). Over 1,500 such third-party commercial providers are accredited to use HMRC’s third party integration suite (APIs).

Around 30% of digital filings to Companies House are made via its
software filing service which offers an API for the transmission of data
from commercial software packages. The clients of over 80 software
providers use this service.
