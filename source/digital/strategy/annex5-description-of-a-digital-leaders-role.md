##Annex 5 - Description of a Digital Leader’s role

A new Digital Leaders Network was established in early 2012 to drive
forward the digital agenda across government. The network is run by the
Government Digital Service and is made up of a departmental Digital
Leader from each main government department, plus Digital Leaders from
each of the Devolved Administrations. A draft job description was
reviewed at the Digital Leaders meeting on 27 March 2012. It was amended
following the meeting to include a specific job description to reflect
the slightly different role of the Devolved Administration members.
