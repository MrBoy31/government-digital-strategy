<p begin="00:00:00" end="00:00:06">My name’s Alice Newton and I’m on the
graduate fast stream. I didn’t know any
</p>

<p begin="00:00:06" end="00:00:09">Agile before I came to the government
digital service, so I’ve had a chance to
</p>

<p begin="00:00:09" end="00:00:15">learn about Agile and how it works. For me
in particular it’s meant going out into
</p>

<p begin="00:00:15" end="00:00:21">departments where they have an idea of a product
they want, rewinding them a couple of steps
</p>

<p begin="00:00:21" end="00:00:27">and asking them to think about the user needs
that they’re actually trying to serve. Then
</p>

<p begin="00:00:27" end="00:00:32">working with them to see, building on the
user needs, what would be the right product
</p>

<p begin="00:00:32" end="00:00:35">to deliver.
It’s been a good experience. A lot of people
</p>

<p begin="00:00:35" end="00:00:39">around the departments have been quite hesitant
about trying Agile as it’s something very
</p>

<p begin="00:00:39" end="00:00:43">new to them. But I’ve universally found
on my projects that afterwards, they think
</p>

<p begin="00:00:43" end="00:00:46">it’s something they’d love to do again
and they’ve been really pleased with the
</p>

<p begin="00:00:46" end="00:00:51">outcome.
Number 10 dashboard has been my biggest product
</p>

<p begin="00:00:51" end="00:00:58">so far. It’s meant to be a dashboard to
give the Prime Minister and other senior officials
</p>

<p begin="00:00:58" end="00:01:04">the most up-to-date view on government priorities.
Whether that’s housing to national business
</p>

<p begin="00:01:04" end="00:01:11">or local growth, they should be able to open
the dashboard and the Prime Minister accesses
</p>

<p begin="00:01:11" end="00:01:16">it on his iPad. Once they’ve opened that
dashboard, they’ll have access to the latest
</p>

<p begin="00:01:16" end="00:01:22">government data and external data, as well
as commentary and analysis by top analysts
</p>

<p begin="00:01:22" end="00:01:25">in the government.
When the Prime Minister opens up the dashboard,
</p>

<p begin="00:01:25" end="00:01:31">the first thing he’ll see is a page giving
him the daily political context. This has
</p>

<p begin="00:01:31" end="00:01:35">been built with the input of the Prime Minister.
I was able to meet the Prime Minister after
</p>

<p begin="00:01:35" end="00:01:40">we’d finished the alpha version of the app
and show it to him and get some direct feedback,
</p>

<p begin="00:01:40" end="00:01:45">which was of course incredibly valuable, to
be able to speak to your users. My favourite
</p>

<p begin="00:01:45" end="00:01:49">thing that he said was that he liked it so
much, he was looking forward to showing it
</p>

<p begin="00:01:49" end="00:01:54">to Obama at the G8.
I would love to tell senior civil servants
</p>

<p begin="00:01:54" end="00:01:59">about all the opportunities that exist in
digital, and how fast streamers are some of
</p>

<p begin="00:01:59" end="00:02:03">the best people to take advantage of them,
since me and the people younger than me are
</p>

<p begin="00:02:03" end="00:02:08">probably the first generation of digital natives
coming through. I’m having a lot of fun.
</p>

<p begin="00:02:08" end="00:02:15">It’s been a brilliant first job to come
into, really. It’s great to be in an organisation
</p>

<p begin="00:02:16" end="00:02:20">where Post-Its are thrown up on the walls,
everyone feels very relaxed, you’re allowed
</p>

<p begin="00:02:20" end="00:02:26">to have ideas, you’re encouraged to have
ideas. You’re working on some really important
</p>

<p begin="00:02:26" end="00:02:31">projects for this country and, yes, just enjoying
it while you do it.
