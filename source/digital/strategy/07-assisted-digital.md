##07 Assisted digital

We recognise that not everyone who uses government services is online, and that not everyone will be able to use digital services independently.
The government has to ensure fair access to services for those who are entitled to them. 
To design services that work for users, we need to understand who can use digital services, who can’t, and what else we need to provide for people who aren’t online.

What we provide for people who aren’t online will depend on the service
and the needs of the user. Many people who are offline will keep using
the services in non-digital ways, such as face to face, by phone and
through intermediaries. In some cases, people may be offered help to use
the digital channel.

We call this ‘assisted digital’. This is an integral part of providing
digital by default services. Departments will consider how they will
provide this assistance at the same time as they are digitally
transforming their services. Government Digital Service will work with
departments to develop a [cross-government approach](/digital/assisted/) to this issue. This
is to ensure those users who need this help receive a consistent service
across the multiple services they use.
