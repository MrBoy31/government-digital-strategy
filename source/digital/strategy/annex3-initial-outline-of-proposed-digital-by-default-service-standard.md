##Annex 3 - Initial outline of proposed digital by default (transactional) service standard

The digital by default standard will define what is considered
high quality for a new or redesigned digital transactional service. It
will be used across government to ensure that all digital services are
of a consistently high standard.

The guidance and tools supporting the standard will help Service Managers
to design trusted, cost-effective government services that are embraced
by users and meet their needs first time. Government Digital Service
will ensure there is a common understanding across government of what
outcomes are required to meet the standard. This understanding must be
shared by everyone involved in the development and life of a new or
redesigned digital service.

The standard will be accompanied by:

*   a programme of guidance and toolkits that help service teams to
    achieve outcomes which meet the standard throughout the development
    and life of the service. This guidance will build and expand upon
    previous Government Digital Service best practice, including:
    *   Government Digital Service Design Principles
    *   Performance Framework
    *   visual and interaction design toolkits
    *   content style guides
*   a reporting tool that makes it simple to demonstrate the
    performance of new and redesigned services against the standard, and
    provides Service Managers with an easy-to-use dashboard to monitor the
    progress of a service’s redesign against the capabilities required
    to pass the standard
*   a governance structure detailing what level of assessment against
    the performance outcomes is required at different stages of a
    redesign project and who will conduct that assessment, according to
    the size and/or impact of the service being redesigned
*   a programme of communications that explains the standard, provides
    training and support and encourages effective knowledge sharing
    between departments

The following description of the standard represents an early draft of
what it may contain. Any numbers contained within it are indicative and
subject to change. This will be improved over the next few months as
Government Digital Service adds more detailed definition and supporting
evidence behind the standard’s requirements in terms of performance
outcomes and capabilities. Government Digital Service will consult with
departments on the details of the standard.

###The standard

Judgements about the quality of a redesigned service should ultimately
be made by its users. The digital standard will set out metrics for monitoring and evaluating how well user needs are being met
by redesigned services, and a capability checklist to guide service
owners and designers in building the transactions to meet those needs. All new and redesigned services must perform well
across a range of areas to meet this standard. 

Government Digital Service will consult with departments on the details
of the digital standard over the next 6 months.

####Service uptake

-   redesigned transactional services must follow a trajectory of
    digital channel uptake, set at a speed according to the service’s
    expected user demographics and in line with service-specific user research and feedback. This will be used for forecasting and setting targets; whilst these will vary service by service, general best practice suggests that an outcome of around 80% of transactions 
completed digitally without assistance within 5 years of launch could be achievable
-   progress against the uptake trajectory will be monitored by
    Service Managers continuously, and by Government Digital Service at
    intervals set according to the size and/or impact of the service

####Cost per transaction

-   redesigned transactional services must demonstrate they are
    following a downward trajectory for the average cost per completed
    transaction. This will be defined in line with the Quarterly Data Summary
    (QDS) guidance, ie by dividing the total number of transactions by
    the full cost of the transactional service
-   performance will be monitored against achieving a fixed baseline
    cost per transaction (which Government Digital Service will determine) within 5 years of
    launch. Government Digital Service will analyse QDS data returns for
    Q3 and Q4 2012/13 to set the baseline cost and trajectory
-   progress against the cost per transaction trajectory will be
    monitored at least quarterly, in line with the QDS reporting cycle

####Transaction success rate

-   redesigned transactional services must achieve at least a baseline
    level of transaction success, defined as users successfully
    fulfilling their needs by using the service
-   Government Digital Service will work with web analytics experts to
    develop a detailed definition of service success to be included in
    the standard, and set the baseline level of performance according to
    industry-recognised best practice

####User satisfaction

-   redesigned transactional services must be designed to meet
    identified user needs, and consistently achieve a satisfaction rate
    of at least 70%. This score will be based on a common survey
    sampling methodology and set of questions
-   Government Digital Service will work with user testing experts and
    departments to build an established methodology for redesigned
    transactions, ensuring that all services have customer satisfaction
    data which is automatically collected and easily comparable between
    different services and over time

####Operational capability

Redesigned transactional services should be:

-   managed by a suitably skilled and empowered Service Manager
-   designed to work seamlessly through digital and non-digital stages
    of a process
-   measuring and monitoring performance against key indicators from
    the point of launch
-   improved at least monthly based on qualitative feedback from users
    and quantitative measures from analytics

####Design

Redesigned transactional services will be:

-   simple and intuitive enough for users to succeed first time,
    unaided
-   designed for inclusion, so all who could use it do use it
-   make use of common design and user experience tools, so once
    people have done something once, they will be able to do it
    elsewhere
-   redesigned using feedback received from a private or public alpha
    phase, and a public beta phase

####Development and technology

Redesigned transactional services should be:

-   developed using agile, iterative, user-centric digital development
    methodologies, using open source code by default
-   make use of common cross-government technology platforms
-   make use of and meet open standards
-   offer high-quality APIs, enabling reliable reuse by third parties
    and integration with other government services
-   capable of working on all common browsers and a wide range of
    web-enabled devices, including mobile phones
-   impartially, robustly and regularly tested throughout the design
    and lifetime of the service

####Legality, security and resilience

Transactional services will be redesigned to:

-   be robustly protective of the security of sensitive user information
-   maintain the privacy and security of all personal information
-   be resilient, to ensure continuity of service to users and
    departments

###The guidance

Government Digital Service will actively support transactional service
owners in helping them to commission, design, build and iteratively
improve services that meet and maintain the digital by default standard.

Government Digital Service has already produced a number of best
practice guidance documents to support departments looking to improve
the quality of their transactional service and digital offering,
including the Design Principles and Performance Framework. Building on
and incorporating these products, Government Digital Service will
develop a ‘handbook’ to support the digital by default standard, with
practical steps and best practice examples to bring the steps redesigned
services will take to life. This will include information to cover all
core capability requirements set out in the standard.

Government Digital Service will work closely with departments on the
development of the guidance and ensure it remains a working document. It
will seek to iteratively improve this as further examples of good practice
come to light, and encourage Service Managers to inform future versions.

To accompany the written guidance, Government Digital Service will set
up a series of training and tutorial opportunities for Service Managers.
These will be based around a core curriculum that covers the
capabilities as set out in the standard, and focused on areas which the
Service Managers themselves raise as being particularly valuable in terms
of targeted support and expert advice.

Government Digital Service will bring in government and external experts
from areas such as web analytics, data visualisation and user testing to
support this curriculum, and give Service Managers the networks,
opportunities and forums to share knowledge between themselves.

Where departments have nominated specific large transactional services
for redesign, Government Digital Service will seek to provide targeted
project support. The terms and level of involvement will be decided on a
case-by-case basis, according to the level and type of transformation in
scope.

###How services will be assessed

For all new and redesigned services, progress should be continually
measured against performance outcomes by Service Managers, using the
reporting tool built by Government Digital Service. Government Digital
Service will monitor at intervals according to the size of the service.

All services will undergo a formal review ahead of launch. After launch,
they will continue to be continually monitored by Service Managers and by
Government Digital Service at regular intervals to ensure that the
standard is being maintained and services are iteratively improved.
