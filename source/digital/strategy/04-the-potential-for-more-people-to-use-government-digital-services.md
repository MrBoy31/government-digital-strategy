##04 The potential for more people to use government digital services

###People who are already online

82% of the UK population are currently online and there is a clear opportunity for government to deliver services
digitally to them. Although 77% of adults in the UK use 
the internet daily, [many of them have never had any online interaction 
with government](/digital/research/#fig-2).

%    | Internet use
---- | --------------------------------------------------------|
82%  | Online (access the Internet regularly or occasionally)  | 
18%  | Offline (never used/rarely used the Internet)           |

A growing proportion of people are [willing and able to use more complex
digital services](/digital/research/#fig-3) that involve a high level of trust such as shopping and
online banking. An [Oxford Internet Institute survey (OxIS)](http://microsites.oii.ox.ac.uk/oxis/) from 2011 shows that the proportion of internet users who shop online grew from 74% in 2005 to 86% in 2011;
online banking usage grew from 45% in 2005 to 60% in 2011; and internet
users who pay bills online grew from 39% in 2005 to 57% in 2011.

The popularity of online channels is recognised across the private
sector, demonstrated by the fact that [internet advertising’s share of
total UK advertising spend has risen to 33%](http://www.zenithoptimedia.com/zenith/zenithoptimedia-releases-new-ad-forecasts-global-advertising-continues-to-grow-despite-eurozone-fears/), well ahead of any other country, as
UK advertisers respond to their customers’ attention shifting online.

Furthermore, digital services are rapidly gaining strong reputations and
loyalty from users. A [recent YouGov poll](http://yougov.co.uk/news/2012/07/11/best-amazon-google-bbc-iplayer/) saw Amazon, Google and iPlayer
become the highest-rated brands in the UK, overtaking more traditional
companies such as John Lewis and Marks & Spencer.

The people who use digital services do so for [reasons of speed and
convenience](/digital/research/#fig-4). 
The most frequent reasons people gave for choosing to use digital transactions were: it saved me a lot of time (85%), the site was clear and easy to use (62%), and I could do it outside office hours (61%).

54% of UK adults have used a government service/information online,
but most of those have used only a small number of services, and many
have just used one. Moreover, according to 2011 [OxIS research](http://microsites.oii.ox.ac.uk/oxis/), 
the number of people using online government services has steadily increased from 39% in 2005 to 57% in 2011, but since 2007
this reach has plateaued.

| Percentage of UK adult population | Completed digital transactions            |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------|
| 46%  | Online and have used a government transaction online                   |
| 8%   | Online and have accessed government information online                 |
| 28%  | Online and have not used government information or transactions online |
| 6%   | Offline and willing to get online                                      |
| 12%  | Offline and unwilling to get online                                    |

###Helping more people to use online services

Not everyone is online. Through our assisted digital programme, we will
help more people to use online services.

Those in higher socio-economic groups (ABCs) are [more likely to be online](/digital/research/#fig-5), 
with 92% regularly or occasionally accessing the internet. 28%
of disabled people are not online (rarely access/have never used the
internet), and older people are more likely to be offline than other age
groups (however 59% of people aged over 65 are online). Geography
doesn’t appear to have too great an influence on whether people access
the internet or not, as people are offline in urban, suburban and rural
areas.

A third of the people who are offline (ie 6% of the UK population) said they are interested in using
the internet, suggesting that the number of people who are online
may increase over time.

###People who use mobile devices to get online

Digital services must adapt seamlessly to meet the needs of mobile
internet users. The new digital service standard will include a
requirement to design digital services that are usable on mobile devices
as well as desktop and laptop computers.

In recent years there have been large advances in the portability and
range of internet enabled devices. This has [changed the way users access
the internet](/digital/research/#fig-6). The most popular devices used to access the internet are
laptops and desktops (73% and 59% respectively), but mobile phone
ownership is now widespread (86% of UK adults have a mobile phone). 56%
of UK adults own a mobile that is internet-enabled, and their use to
access the internet is growing.

The [London 2012 Olympic Games provides a recent example of this trend
towards mobile use](http://www.slideshare.net/balf/london-2012com-olympic-games-digital-round-up-13-august-2012), with over 60% of all visitors to the Games’ website
coming from mobile phones.

[OxIS research](http://microsites.oii.ox.ac.uk/oxis/) shows that ownership of internet-enabled phones continues to grow among all income
groups. This will increase the number of people who can access the
internet. There is little correlation between the use of mobiles for the
internet and annual income, with 35% of mobile internet users earning
above £30,000 and 39% earning below £12,500. With 69% of current
non-internet users owning a mobile, there is scope to increase access to
internet-based information and services through this route.

Based on banking industry experience, this mobile web usage tends to be
focused on simple straightforward transactions, notably progress
tracking. This offers the potential to shift a high volume of this type of transaction across to digital
self-service, resulting in savings from reduced use of more expensive telephony channels.
