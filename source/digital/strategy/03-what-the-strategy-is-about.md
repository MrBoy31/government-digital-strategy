##03 What the strategy is about

This strategy is mainly about the services provided by central
government departments and associated agencies and arm's length bodies.
Some matters covered by the strategy are devolved and reference should
be made to the Devolved Administrations for more details as to how this
strategy affect their areas.

However, in order to provide public services digitally by default, all
public bodies will need to work together. Most public services are
provided by local organisations such as local councils and the NHS.
People often use a range of services, not just one at a time. Most
people and businesses don’t differentiate between different levels and
types of public services; they just want a good service.

To help other organisations improve their digital services, we will:

-   make the digital assets (standards, designs and code) generated as
    a result of this strategy widely available
-   share central government plans with local authorities and other
    public bodies
-   work with local councils and their representative and
    professional bodies to help them to make improvements

The actions in this strategy are mainly about transactional services
such as applications, tax, licensing and payments. The strategy explains
how the civil service will develop new skills and approaches to
complement its existing expertise. It also includes actions to improve
the way the government makes policy and communicates with people.

This strategy is about users of services within the UK. Users overseas
will be covered in appropriate departmental strategies.

DCMS is already leading on providing [superfast broadband](http://www.culture.gov.uk/what_we_do/telecommunications_and_online/7763.aspx) to at least 90% of premises in the UK and providing universal
access to standard broadband with a speed of at least 2Mbps.

###The benefits of digital by default

Digital by default services are more efficient and more convenient for
users. [Our initial testing](http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/2012/01/13/quantitative-testing-betagov/) comparing GOV.UK to the previous Directgov
and Businesslink.gov.uk sites shows a more positive rating on both ease of use
(93% compared with 75% before) and speed (80 seconds as opposed to 120
seconds to undertake comparable transactions).

Government will save money if demand for higher cost channels decreases.
A [2012 SOCITM study](http://www.socitm.net/press/article/213/two_thirds_of_customer_contacts_with_local_authorities_are_now_online_says_new_research_from_socitm) across 120 local councils estimated that the cost
of contact for face to face transactions averages £8.62, for phone £2.83, but for web
only 15 pence. The [Digital Efficiency Report](/digital/efficiency/) found that the average cost
of a central government digital transaction can be [almost 20 times
lower than the cost of telephone and 50 times lower than face to face](/digital/efficiency/#fnref:1).

In 2010 [HMRC estimated](http://www.nao.org.uk/publications/0910/handling_telephone_enquiries.aspx) that around 35% of calls to its contact centres
were avoidable at an National Audit Office estimated cost of £75 million a
year. Changes have since been made to processes, letters and forms that
have reduced the total number of calls and the proportion of avoidable
calls to around 26% of the total.

On the basis of historical savings achieved by existing digital services
we estimate that £1.7 to £1.8 billion of total annual savings could be made by shifting
the transactional services offered by central government departments from offline to
digital channels. Of this, £1.1 to £1.3 billion will be saved directly by the government,
with the rest passed on to service users through lower prices. These figures do not include
the potential costs of a transition to digital, but also do not include the additional
savings that could be gained from fundamental service redesign or back-end technology
changes.

Evidence from [the Digital Efficiency Report case studies](/digital/efficiency/#list-of-case-studies) demonstrates
public services exhibiting a typical technology adoption S-curve. For
services at around 20% digital take-up, there is the opportunity to
rapidly increase adoption to 80% within 3 to 5 years. This will be further
increased where digitisation is accelerated by a process of fundamental
service redesign based on user needs.

Digitising transactional services will save people and businesses time
and money; by making transactions faster, reducing the number of failed
transactions and simplifying the end-to-end process. Our estimates
suggest that an hour spent interacting with government [costs the average
citizen £14.70](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/research/cost-of-time.pdf). If just half an hour were saved by digitising every transaction currently completed offline, the total savings to the
economy [could therefore be around £1.8 billion](/digital/efficiency/#estimates-of-total-annual-savings). 
Furthermore, many public services are run by agencies that recover their 
costs directly through user charges, so reducing costs provides the potential 
for savings to be passed on to users.
