##Annex 5 - Departmental savings methodology

###Overview of the approach

Three inputs drive the estimate of potential departmental cost savings

1. **Transactional service costs**  
Estimates of transactional service costs are based on departmental and agency accounts, supplemented by further details from case studies ands
other publicly available information. Further details on this are in [Section 2](#what-are-the-savings-from-digitising-transactional-services) of the main report.

2. **Transactional service channel mix (% digital)**  
Where data was available, actual figures for the service channel mix were used. Where data was not available, it was assumed that the % digital take-up for services was 46% - based on an average of the known digital take-up rates across government services. It was assumed that the remaining offline transactions were split by 80% phone and 20% face-to-face.
We recognise that this ratio will vary across Departments, depending on the nature of transactional services they offer. 

3. **Cost savings % resulting from a shift from an offline to digital channel**  
A variety of benchmarks for relative channel cost were used. These are explained in further detail below.

The analysis shows a high degree of sensitivity to cost ratios used.
                        
####Sensitivity to estimated transaction-related costs

The sensitivity of estimated potential cost savings to estimated
transaction costs by department is linear. Every 10% change in estimated
transaction-related costs for each department would result in a 10%
change in the same direction to estimates of potential cost savings for
that department.          

####Sensitivity to channel split                

There are a relatively small number of transactions corresponding to
services for which we are using the assumed digital take-up figure.
Consequently, the total estimated potential cost savings are quite
insensitive to the variable. However, such sensitivity may be higher for
individual departments with a disproportional number of transactions
with unknown digital take- up.

| 70% phone / 30% face-to-face                    | £1.76                       |
| ***80% phone / 20% face-to-face***                    | ***£1.71***                       |
| 90% phone / 10% face-to-face                    | £1.66                       |
| 100% phone / 0% face-to-face                    | £1.63                       |


####Sensitivity of cost saving to channel cost ratios

The sensitivity analysis shows a high degree of sensitivity to the
channel cost ratios used. We have further analyzed sensitivity of the
model and the potential cost savings estimate to some of the key
variables. Departmental figures will be much more sensitive than the
total figure to each of those variables.

| ***Balanced mix varied by department according to data where available and benchmarks*** | ***£1.7bn*** | ***Base estimate; mix of channel cost benchmarks and case study data.*** |

As indicated by the ranges of the estimated transaction costs by
department and the sensitivity analysis to other key estimates and
assumptions, potential cost savings estimates can be strengthened to
reduce variability. The estimates present the best available external
view.The next step would be to reduce the number of estimates and
assumptions that have been made based on judgment, and replace them
(wherever possible) with factual data. An iterative process would result
in better-informed and more customized estimates for every service,
agency and department, but require a considerable degree of additional
analysis.

####Estimates of transaction related costs

The top-down approach was built by estimating the transaction-related
expenditure associated with each department. For the transaction-focused
agencies, we deducted all non-transaction related costs from the total
agency expenditure (eg grants, non-cash costs) from the annual
reports, and aggregated these at a department-level to estimate
transaction-related expenditure. For all other departments/agencies
whose main purpose is not transactional in nature, the major
transaction-related cost categories were identified using departmental
and agency annual reports, and included categories such as staff and
other costs of service delivery. This analysis was carried out for the
13 largest departments, out of a total of 15 relevant departments and
covered 99.9% of total transactions (some departments with a small
number of transactions were excluded as they are primarily
non-transactional in nature).

The cost recovery % figure estimates, to the nearest 10%, the proportion of savings that will be passed on directly to service users. The estimates savings are also shown in Fig 9.

As in Figure 9, these savings estimates are based on historic 11/12 financial data. New policy initiatives, 
such as Universal Credit, are likely to affect both the total savings potential of specific Departments. The 
actual savings potential will be as set out in Departmental Digital Strategies published at the end of 2012.
