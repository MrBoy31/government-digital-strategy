[^1]: Driving Standards Agency data, 2011/12: £6.62 post, £4.11 telephone, £0.22 digital per transaction.

[^2]: Of this, £1.1 - £1.3 billion (approximately 65%) will accrue directly to the government accounts as cash-releasing fiscal savings for the taxpayer. The remainder will be passed on directly as savings to service users. This split is explained in further detail in Annex 2.

[^3]: HMRC, [Costing Customer Time Research Paper](http://www.nao.org.uk/publications/0910/handling_telephone_enquiries.aspx), 2009. In the 2009 report ‘Champion for Digital Inclusion’ (RaceOnline, PwC), it was stated that people could save between £3.30 and £12.00 for every Government transaction they completed digitally instead of offline.

[^4]: These savings may alternatively be claimed as leisure time.

[^5]: These services account for over half of the 1.5 billion transactions that take place across the whole of government.

[^6]: This estimate is based on analysis of published government accounts to identify costs specifically related to the delivery of transactional services. More detail on the top-down methodology used to produce this figure is set out in Section 2 of this report.

[^10]: The choice of 82% digital take-up is made on the basis of the Government Digital Service Digital Landscape Research, published alongside the Government Digital Strategy (2012). The research found that only 18% of people either very rarely use the internet, or not use it at all.

[^11]: Estimates based on time spent per transaction in a non-digital channel by service and cost per FTE per minute. The model also includes estimates for rent, IT, and materials per transaction.

[^12]: This graph includes automated electronic transactions (as digital) and Job Seekers Allowance claim transactions (as non-digital). However, these have been excluded from the aggregated departmental figures when calculating savings estimates because they distort the savings potential that exists from making individual transactional services digital by default. This should not detract from the significant efficiencies that electronic transactions have generated.

[^13]: The lower / upper bounds reflect the range of estimates for total transaction costs across departments.

[^14]: This estimate assumes a full FTE average cost of approximately £36,000. This figure is based on Cabinet Office analysis of the average annual FTE cost across government.

[^15]: The majority of these FTEs are expected to be civil servants, though a proportion will be employees of companies responsible for outsourced government services.

[^16]: ‘Digital by default’ is defined as the base case scenario set out earlier - a shift to 82% digital take-up for all services with over 10,000 transactions per year.

[^17]: The take-up rates for each specific case study are illustrated in Annex 4.

[^18]: It is likely that using this average figure overestimates the digital penetration of some services, which will lead to a smaller estimate of the potential savings.

[^19]: As explained in the main report, the choice of 82% digital take-up is made on the basis of the Government Digital Service Digital Landscape Research, published alongside the [Government Digital Strategy](/digital/strategy/).

[^20]: This sensitivity calculation excludes departments where specific estimates on channel split were based upon published data or information disclosed through the case studies.

[^21]: The [SOCITM study](http://www.socitm.net/press/article/213/two_thirds_of_customer_contacts_with_local_authorities_are_now_online_says_new_research_from_socitm) estimated average UK council costs per transaction of 15 pence, £2.83, and £8.62 for transactions done digitally, by phone, or face to face, respectively. Such costs would result in cost ratios of 2%, 33%, 100%. However, we used a 30 pence cost assumption for digital transactions as suggested by other studies with similar ranges for telephone and face-face costs.

[^22]: The savings calculation for DWP includes data from Jobcentre Plus published accounts that includes the cost of face to face Fortnightly Job Reviews (FJRs) for Jobseekers Allowance. The Jobcentre Plus accounts do not include a disaggregation for FJRs so these are included in the estimated transaction costs for DWP. Approximately 40 million FJRs are carried out every year, so the inclusion of these costs may inflate the cost per transaction figure used for the purposes of this report.
