##06 How long will shifting to digital take?

The figures quoted thus far in this report represent potential total
annual savings - the difference between the total annual cost of running
a transactional service at its current level of digitisation and the
total annual cost of running the same service after a shift to digital
by default.[^16]

To understand the trajectory for realising the benefits from
digitisation, it is helpful to look at the historical take-up of
digitised transactional services. The data showing take-up rates for the
17 case studies has been consolidated to create a generic path
for the digitisation of transactional services.[^17]

Evidence from the case studies demonstrates public services exhibiting a
typical technology adoption S-curve. For services at around 20% digital
take-up, the rate of adoption tends increases as they become
increasingly accepted by the mainstream, often reaching 80% take-up
within 3 to 5 years. The pace of change could be further increased where
digitisation is driven by a process of fundamental service redesign
focused on meeting user needs.

Based on this historic S-curve, total in-year savings are expected to
rise to approximately £0.6 billion in 2014/15 and £1.0 billion in
2016/17. The total savings made over the remainder of the current
spending review period are approximately £1.2 billion.

2012/13 | 0.16

2015/16 | 0.89
2016/17 | 1.04

The time frame of this S-curve starkly contrasts with what is delivered
by today’s high-performing transactional services. It is reasonable to
believe that the historic S-curve is not reflective of the pace of
digitisation possible today.

Making savings through digital can be a challenging process. The
services studied for this report overcame potential blockers in their
progress towards digitisation. As well as overcoming these blockages,
these services have used tools and techniques to improve the success of
channel shift, and increase the speed of digitisation.

####Rewarding digital users

Using differential prices (eg for ordering official copies of Land
Registry documents), submission deadlines (eg HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) self-assessment
return) or levels of assistance (eg Companies House pre-populating
digital forms), between digital and offline channels have effectively
encouraged customers to move away from using less cost-effective
channels. This has proved an effective tactic not only for generating
savings, but also for the powerful message it sends to users.

####Raising customer awareness

Some organisations, such as Companies House, have successfully driven up
digital take-up through campaigns based on customer insight gained from
primary research. Digital take-up was accelerated through emphasising
the benefits of digital; improved security; faster confirmation of
success; quicker payment mechanisms; and access to immediate online
help.

####Effective internal engagement

Like all major organisational changes, shifting to digital needs to be
handled sensitively. When transforming their services, departments and
agencies have found early engagement with unions and staff important and
effective. In anticipation of any headcount reductions, effective
communication, recruitment freezes and cross-organisation planning have
avoided the need for compulsory redundancies, minimising the disruptive
effects on staff and productivity.

####Overcoming legislative barriers

Some organisations' experience of introducing digital services or trying
to drive higher take-up by withdrawing offline channels has involved
lengthy consultation and approval processes. To make substantial savings
from digital, the time and amount of bureaucracy involved in gaining the
relevant approvals needs to be minimised wherever possible.

####Managing security risks        

Digital services bring unique challenges in making sure users’ personal
information and identity is protected. Identity assurance has the
potential to increase the security requirements, complexity and cost of
digital services. To reduce the cost and risk of owning sensitive data,
some services (eg free school meal applications) have made links to
databases hosted in other areas of government (in this case, those held by DWP). This has helped to reduce
security risk and avoid unnecessary duplication of storage systems.

####Working with partner organisations

Digital services are often more dependent on partner organisations than
offline channel equivalents. To deal with this, services have built a
level of tolerance into their processes to avoid the failure of one
component breaking the entire transaction. For example, the Driving
Standards Agency can continue to serve customers booking a practical
driving test online even if links to the databases confirming the
applicant’s provisional licence and the theory test status are
unavailable, by holding applications in stasis until links are restored.
Similarly, Companies House and HMRC have engaged with software providers
to enable the integration of their service within the programmes,
processes and systems business customers use to file returns.

####Increased digital capability

By employing staff with specific responsibility for service provision
and quality who have a high level of digital skills, government
organisations are in a stronger position to monitor and iteratively
improve the performance of their transactional services. The Government
Digital Strategy sets out the steps for increasing the level of these
skills across government in order to build world-class transactional
services that encourage faster user take-up.

Looking forward, it is reasonable to assume that these lessons learned,
in combination with the new approach to digital set out in the
Government Digital Strategy, would result in a compressed S-curve,
representing a faster pace of more comprehensive digitisation that goes beyond 
a 82% digital uptake rate. This would be expected to
yield higher savings more quickly. The in-year savings shown below are
consistent with a digital take-up curve twice as fast as one based on
historic data. This has been chosen to illustrate the effect of faster
digitisation on potential in-year savings, rather than in expectation
that this specific rate of take-up will be achieved.
