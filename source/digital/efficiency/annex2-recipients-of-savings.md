##Annex 2 - Recipients of savings

Some of the government’s transactional services are paid for directly
through departmental budgets, whilst others are paid for by customers of
those services.

This means that some of the savings from digitising transactional
services will benefit the government and some will directly benefit
consumers (since the savings would be passed on to them in lower prices
for the service). In this report savings to government are described as
“cash-releasing”, fiscal savings and savings to customers are described
as cost recovery savings.

The split between the two types of savings is shown in [Fig. 5](#fig-5).
