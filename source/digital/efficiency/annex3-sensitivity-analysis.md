##Annex 3 - Sensitivity analysis

Throughout this report, base case assumptions have been made about the
level of digital take-up defined as digital by default and about the
size of transactional service below which savings are assumed not to be
generated. The figures highlighted below in bold relate to the base case
estimates quoted thus far in the report, for a digital by default
take-up rate of 82% digital, and a volume threshold of 10,000
transactions each year.                  

The figures that have been greyed out in the grid below are considered
less reliable estimates for potential savings. This is because all
quoted savings figures are gross of any investment required to realise
them. For lower volume services, such as applying for a permit for
burial at sea, the level of investment needed for successful
digitisation is likely to exceed the savings returned as a result until
transaction platforms are developed. Common technology platforms that
fit a standard transaction type will reduce the need for building new
digital services from scratch, and may ultimately make digitising
smaller transactional services economically viable. However, savings
from these much smaller services are unlikely to be realisable during
the current spending review period (up to 2014/15).
