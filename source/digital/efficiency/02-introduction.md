##02 Introduction

The way people connect with government is changing.

20 years ago, technology was very different. Communicating with
public servants required filling in paper forms, arranging face-to-face
meetings, or picking up a phone. Completing simple tasks often meant
false starts, weeks of effort and wasted public money.

Today, digital services can harness the power and convenience of the web
to make these interactions quicker, simpler and more secure. Millions of
pounds have already been saved by bringing some public services online,
with users also getting a better experience.

As the [Government Digital Strategy](/digital/strategy/) explains, 
digitised transactional services present an unmissable opportunity for the UK.
There is a strong body of evidence to support the idea that digital
delivery of public services can produce a service at least as strong as
that offered through other channels at a lower unit cost. For some
government services, the average cost of a digital transaction is almost
20 times lower than the cost of a telephone transaction, about
30 times lower than the cost of postal transaction[^1] and about 
50 times lower than a face-to-face transaction. Digitisation is also likely to reduce the risk
of failed transactions, and therefore the business cost of having to go
through the same process multiple times.

Consumers have embraced online services in recent years, with [almost two-thirds](http://http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/market-data-research/market-data/communications-market-reports/cmr12/internet-web/)
(64%) of people saying they have used online banking services, and [86% of internet users 
having shopped online in 2011](/digital/strategy/). As a consequence of this shift, 
some companies have achieved substantial cost savings. Government bodies are equally keen to
digitise their public services and realise the potential efficiency
gains. The City of Copenhagen estimates that digital transactions will
cost [less than 5% than the equivalent face-to-face
interaction](http://www.regjeringen.no/upload/FAD/Kampanje/DAN/Regjeringensdigitaliseringsprogram/digit_prg_eng.pdf).

The future prize for government of going digital by default could be huge. From analysis 
of savings that can be robustly projected using historical data from existing digital
services, it is estimated that a further £1.7 to £1.8 billion of total
annual savings can be made by shifting the transactional services
currently offered by central government departments from offline to
digital channels.[^2] Savings are likely to arise through reductions in staff, estates,
materials and office equipment costs.

These figures are inclusive of any savings arising from digitisation
that have already been included in departmental business plans. They also exclude any
transitional or investment costs that may be required to release them.
These costs are not insignificant. It will take time, effort and money to
develop the flexibility and capability to do digital well across
government. However, the figures do give a sense of scale to the huge efficiency
potential that exists in digital services. This report explains how,
when and where those savings could be made.

Conducting government services online is not just good for the public
purse. It is also good for economic growth. Government estimates suggest
that an hour spent interacting with government costs the average citizen
£14.70.[^3] Over 250 million transactions are still completed
through offline channels every year. If half an hour were saved by
digitising every transaction currently completed offline, the total
savings to the economy could be up to £1.8 billion.[^4]

The savings figures in this report are based on the best data available
for savings already generated through digitising government services. As
a result, they do not fully capture the effects the government’s new
approach to digital. By embedding digital expertise across government,
using a broader range of technology suppliers and redesigning policy
frameworks, the government will have greater capacity to deliver
world-class digital services that yield more efficiency savings, more
quickly. After analysing savings estimates from future digital
transformations, it appears likely that total annual savings from
digitising transactional services could in fact be considerably higher.
It should be noted that this report has not attempted to speculatively
quantify these savings, and instead focuses on providing a robust
estimate on the basis of existing historic data.

[Section 1](#what-does-this-report-cover) defines what is meant by ‘savings’ and ‘transactional
services’, and clarifies the scope of this report.

[Section 2](#what-are-the-savings-from-digitising-transactional-services) explains the methodology used to calculate the potential
savings figures achievable through channel shift (moving from offline
channels like post and phone to digital), and sets out the potential
annual savings figures.

[Section 3](#where-will-the-savings-come-from) sets out which departments are expected to realise savings,
where savings are likely to be made, and examples of the progress
already made by public services towards digitisation.

Finally, [section 4](#how-long-will-shifting-to-digital-take) illustrates when potential savings could be realised,
consolidates some of the lessons learned about the enabling factors
needed to realise savings from digitisation of transactional services,
and shows the potential in-year savings according to different speeds of
digital take-up.
