##04 What are the savings from digitising transactional services?

With transactional activity taking place across a range of diverse
services, working out how much can be saved by conducting them digitally
is not a simple task. To ensure that the findings of this analysis were
robust, two separate methodologies for calculation were used to
corroborate the findings: a bottom-up case study analysis, and a
top-down analysis using aggregated government accounts.  

###Case study analysis

It is impractical to assess the savings potential of over 650 individual
transactional services, so using a representative sample to provide an
assessment for the full picture is essential. Every service was
categorised using four significant factors of savings potential: 

- volume of individual transactions per year
- service function (eg requesting a benefit or grant)
- customer type
- current level of digital take-up

17 case study services from across government were selected on
the basis of covering a spread across the 4 factors, and used to
provide data about the impact of each. They show that services will not
be equal in the extent to which they can achieve savings.

####Volume

Figure 1: Annual savings (£ millions) per 1% shift to digital - by volume
{: .fig #fig-1}

Transaction volume | Savings (£ millions)
------------------ | ---
Under 1 million    | 0.06
1-8 million        | 0.15
Over 8 million     | 0.32

Our analysis suggests that transaction volume is a good linear indicator
of a service’s savings potential. Higher volume services appear to
benefit from economies of scale that allow them to realise greater
savings from each incremental improvement in digital take-up. Below a
threshold of 1 million transactions each year, any economies of scale
are smaller in terms of directly driving additional savings potential.
However, they remain statistically significant, not least because of the
sheer number of services with fewer than 1 million annual transactions
provided by the government.


####Function

Figure 2: Annual savings (£ millions) per 1% shift to digital - by function
{: .fig #fig-2}

| Function                           | Savings (£ millions)  |
| ---------------------------------- |------ |
| Ordering goods                     | 0.39  |
| Providing information              | 0.18  |
| Making a payment (taxes and fines) | 0.13  |
| Requesting benefits/grants/loans   | 0.10  |
| Requesting a licence/authorisation | 0.07  |
| Booking an appointment             | 0.06  |
{: .horizontal-bar-chart .no-key}

Transactional services can be categorised into 6 broad function types.
Function serves as a proxy for the complexity of a transactional
service, as it implies certain things about its requirements including security, number of process steps, and links to other data stores. 
The analysis showed that more complex transactions, and particularly
those that included a financial transfer, appeared to have greater
potential for savings through channel shift than more straightforward
registration or authorisation services.

It should be noted that more complex transactions may also be the most
difficult to migrate to digital channels, and may require commensurately
higher levels of investment. However, it is possible to take an
incremental approach – even in services where full digitisation is not
possible – and still make savings.

####Customer type

Figure 3: Annual savings (£ millions) per 1% shift to digital - by customer type
{: .fig #fig-3}

| Customer type                                      | Savings  |
| -------------------------------------------------- |--------- |
| Government&nbsp;to&nbsp;business                   | 0.18 |
| Government&nbsp;to&nbsp;consumer&nbsp;(challenged) | 0.15 |
| Government&nbsp;to&nbsp;consumer&nbsp;(mainstream) | 0.14 |
{: .horizontal-bar-chart .no-key}

Government transactions cover a wide customer base. To simplify this,
each of the 650-plus transactional services was categorised using one of
three typical customer types; business users, mainstream consumer users,
and less able consumer users. The analysis showed that type of customer
was not a strong indicator of savings potential, though the potential
savings from business-facing transactional services was slightly higher
than those for consumer-facing services.

This report assumes a base case in which services shift to digital by
default, defined as 82% take-up. This figure was chosen on the basis of
the [GDS Digital Landscape Research](/digital/research/), which found that
82% of the UK adult population is online and able to use straightforward
and convenient digital services. We acknowledge, however, that some
services have a higher proportion of users who are less likely to be
online (for example, older people, people with disabilities, people in
lower socioeconomic groups), and therefore might find it more difficult
to reach this level of take-up. We recognise that 82% take up is a challenging target 
for those services which predominantly serve audiences that are less likely 
than the general population to be online. In terms of how digital by default is 
defined, this figure will need to be revisited in the future as more 
evidence is gathered and people's online behaviour evolves.

####Current digital take-up

{: .fig #fig-4}

| Current digital take-up             | Savings (£ millions) |
| ----------------------------------- |------ |
| 0 - 20                    | 0.13  |
| 20 - 40                   | 0.13  |
| 40 - 60                   | 0.25  |
| 60 - 80                   | 0.22  |
| 80 - 100                  | 0.15  |

Many government transactional services have already begun the process of
digitisation. However, there is a wide range in the level of take-up
across services that already possess a digital channel. This analysis
shows that savings can be realised at all stages of channel shift. The
expected amount of savings increases as the level of take-up goes beyond
40%, before slowing steadily as services approach full digitisation. A
fuller explanation of the bottom-up methodology is set out in [Annex 4](#bottom-up-methodology).

###Top-down analysis

The top-down approach is based on estimates of the transaction related
expenditure associated with each department. These estimates used data
taken from published departmental and agency accounts. For
transaction focused agencies (eg [Land Registry](http://www.landregistry.gov.uk)), all costs from the
total agency expenditure unrelated to transactional activity (eg
grants, non-cash costs) were deducted, based on data from the annual
reports, before being aggregated at departmental level.

For departments or agencies whose main purpose is not transactional
(eg [Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO)](http://www.fco.gov.uk)), the major transaction-related cost categories were
identified using departmental and agency annual reports, and included
categories such as staff and other costs of service delivery (eg
telephone, printing & postage, and rents). Cost categories clearly
unrelated to transactions, such as capital outlay on infrastructure or
expenditure on non-transactional services like the police, were
excluded.

For each department, the number of digital transactions by channel was
estimated using data available in some transactional services. For
services known to be digital but lacking data on the percentage of
digital take-up, an average figure was used based on take-up in services
for which the data was available.                            

Unit cost ratios by channel and by department, based on data from the
case studies and external benchmarks (eg local
government)[^9], were applied to the transaction-related
costs by department. Cost ratios were tailored to the type of services
provided by each department where it was believed that the benchmarks
did not appropriately represent cost savings potential (for example, the
switch to digital would have a limited impact on costs for process-heavy
services such as passport applications). This analysis was carried out
for the 13 departments responsible for the largest volume of
transactions. They covered more than 99% of transactions across central
government. A fuller explanation of the top-down methodology is in Annex
5.

###Estimates of total annual savings

In this report, all quoted savings figures assume a base case defined as
all services processing over 10,000 transactions each year shift to 82%
digital take-up.[^10] The bottom-up methodology yields an
annual saving estimate from this shift to digital by default as £1.8
billion. The equivalent top-down figure is £1.7 billion.

Figure 5: Projected total annual savings, split by public spending / cost recovery receipt of savings
{: .fig #fig-5}

| Projected Total Annual Savings | Fiscal | Cost Recovery | Total |
|----|----|---|---|
| Bottom-up | 1.162bn | 0.612bn | 1.78bn |
| Top-down | 1.1bn | 0.623bn | 1.72bn |
{: .horizontal-bar-chart .mc-stacked}

As mentioned previously, our analysis estimated that the total
transaction-related spend across government as being £6 billion to £9
billion. In the historical case study data examined for this report, a
channel shift towards digital by default therefore reduces the total
transactional costs across government by around a fifth.

When this result is examined against the evidence for the relative cost
of digital channels compared to offline alternatives, it implies that
the full benefits of digitisation have not necessarily been realised in
the past. This could be attributed to a number of factors, including
technological improvements in recent years, legislative obstacles, and a
relative lack of digital skills across government. In business cases for
redesigned transactional services just beginning the process of radical
business transformation alongside digitisation (or new digital services
being created to replace existing transactions, such as Universal
Credit), costs are expected to fall by an even greater proportion.
However, given the relative lack of supporting data, this report has not
attempted to quantify these savings.
