##Annex 4 - Bottom-up methodology

###Understanding the savings indicators

The analysis started with hypotheses about the aspects of transactional
services that may be linked to the potential for savings. It was
hypothesised that four variables may play this role. In this report,
these variables are referred to as indicators of savings potential.

*  volume
*  level of digital take-up
*  function
*  customer type

This hypothesis was tested using data from the 17 case studies.
The relative impact of each of these is explained in section 2 of the
main report.

Alongside this analysis, a database was compiled of all the
transactional services across central government within the scope of the
report. Every transactional service was categorised using the 4
indicators of savings potential, using real data for digital take-up
where available, and an average take-up figure when it was
not.[^18] This allows the total savings for each percentage
point shift towards digital by default[^19] across
government to be calculated.

Any transactions which have a volume of less than 10,000 are excluded
from the calculation. This is based on the fact that for services below
this size, the investment and transition costs are likely to be
significant in relation to savings.

###Confidence intervals

To test how statistically significant the indicators of savings
potential are, 95% confidence intervals on each indicator were
calculated. This produced relatively large ranges for the potential
savings generated per percentage shift to digital, probably because the
standard deviation of the savings is large from transaction to
transaction and the sample sizes to determine the savings associated
with each indicator are relatively small.

Nevertheless, the confidence intervals support the hypothesis that
volume is strongly linked to savings potential: a transaction with a
volume of over 8 million will offer greater savings than one with fewer.

| Number of transactional services by department | Low | Medium | High |
|---|---|---|---|

| 1 - 8 million   | £0.11m  | £0.15m  | £0.19m  |
| Over 8 million  | £0.21m  | £0.29m  | £0.37m  |

Function also has a significant impact. However, we cannot prove to 95%
confidence, on the basis of their function alone, that some of the
simpler transactions will offer the potential for any savings.

| Providing Information              | £0.10m  | £0.18m  | £0.26m |

The analysis of digital penetration shows some variation in savings at
different levels, but it is not possible to say with 95% confidence that
the savings vary by level. This allows the methodology to use the
assumption that the savings potential for each percentage take-up of
digital could be broadly constant.

{: .fig #fig-16}

Digital take up - confidence         | Low | Medium | High |
------------------------------------ | ------ | --- | ---- |
0 - 20%   | 0.07 | 0.13 | 0.20 |
20 - 40%  | 0.05 | 0.12 | 0.20 |
40 - 60%  | 0.13 | 0.23 | 0.33 |
60 - 80%  | 0.14 | 0.22 | 0.31 |
80 - 100% | 0.07 | 0.15 | 0.22 |

The same goes for customer type; there is some variation but the confidence intervals are large.

Figure 17: 95% confidence intervals on potential annual savings per 1% shift to digital - by customer type
{: .fig #fig-17}

Customer type - confidence           | Low | Medium | High |
------------------------------------ | ----| ------ | ---- |
business             | 0.13 | 0.18 | 0.22 |
mainstream consumer  | 0.06 | 0.12 | 0.19 |
challenged consumer  | 0.03 | 0.15 | 0.28 |

In contrast to the confidence intervals on the individual indicators of
savings potential, the confidence on the total estimate is tighter. This
means that it has been established, with a probability of 95%, that the
savings potential lies in the range £1.4 billion to £2.2 billion, with
£1.8 billion the expected figure.                 

The reason for this is that the total estimate is calculated from a
larger sample size – all of the years for all of the case studies –
whereas the savings for the individual attributes are calculated from a
subset of data points.

| Confidence                         | Estimated annual savings (£ billions) |

| Low confidence interval            | 1.4   |
| Mid case                           | 1.8   |
| High confidence interval           | 2.2   |

###In-year savings

For each of the case studies, digital penetration has been tracked over
time.

{: .fig #fig-19}

![Figure 19](/assets/images/efficiency/fig19.png)

Putting these historic curves together gives a generic take-up curve for
Government services. It forms an S-curve which is typical of the take-up
of various technologies (Fig 10).

This S-curve enables the calculation of in-year savings. The position of
each service on the curve was established. Where the penetration for a
service was not known, the average across all services was used. To
calculate the in-year annual savings, each transaction was moved along
the curve year by year. This approach was used to calculate the increase
in digital penetration, which was then multiplied by the annual savings
per percentage point.
