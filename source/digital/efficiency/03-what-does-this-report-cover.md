##03 What does this report cover?

###Defining transactional services                   

Transactional services cover a huge range of tasks, from paying car tax
to applying for a passport, and they form a significant part of the
government’s work. These services involve an exchange of money, goods, services,
permissions, licences or information between the government and a
service user, resulting in a change to a government system. This report
focuses on what savings are achievable from conducting these services
through digital channels rather than offline alternatives like phone,
post or face-to-face conversations. Government departments and their agencies are
directly responsible for managing over 650 transactional
services.[^5] The estimated total administration cost of
managing these services in 2011/12 was approximately £6 billion to £9 billion.[^6]

was approximately £6 billion to £9 billion

More than 300 transactional services have no digital channel available
to their users.[^7] Where transactional services currently possess a digital channel, 
many users still choose to carry out their transaction offline. Over 250 million 
transactions a year still take place through post, phone, face-to-face, or other offline
channels.

###Defining savings

This report has adopted the definition of cash-releasing savings as
agreed by the Treasury and Cabinet Office.

The savings figures for digital channel shift based on historic data
quoted in this report are:

*  made specifically by the government, not the UK economy as a whole
*  real cash savings from existing departmental and agency budgets, or where the
    service is managed by an agency run on a cost recovery accounting
    basis, cash savings passed on directly to service users. ([Annex 2](#recipients-of-savings)
    sets out the split between cost recovery and public spending savings
    figures)
*  achievable without substantial changes to existing legislation
*  achievable without reducing the quality of service offered

###The scope of this report

There are many sources of potential IT savings across the public sector.
Shifting transactional service delivery to digital channels is the focus
of this report because it has been identified as a definable source of
potential savings to the government in the short- to medium-term. It is
also the focus of the [Government Digital Strategy](/digital/strategy/). 
However, this does not mean that it represents the full range of savings 
that could be made from IT or digitisation.

Historical data has been used to calculate an estimated total annual
savings figure for digitising transactional services. Because this
figure is based on case studies, Departmental accounts and reasonable
assumptions, as set out in [Annex 4](#bottom-up-methodology), it is reasonable to have confidence
that the government can ultimately realise these through the
digitisation of transactional services.

There is evidence to suggest that the savings achievable through
shifting to digital channels could be multiplied when accompanied by a
comprehensive transformation of the service’s business processes and
back-end technical systems.

As the [Government Digital Strategy](/digital/strategy/) 
explains, the government is putting in place the digital skills, support and standards 
needed to make these transformations both faster and more effective in driving both
efficiency savings and take-up of online channels. To understand the
savings potential of future digital transformations, business cases from
a number of services about to embark on major transformations have been
studied to compare their anticipated future savings with actual savings
realised through past transformations. On this basis, it appears likely
that the upper bound of potential savings from digitising transactions
could be considerably higher.

Exploiting this additional potential will mean making difficult choices.
Radical service transformation often requires extensive investment of
time and resources, changes to primary legislation, and substantial
re-engineering or replacement of the processes and technical systems
that support a transaction. However, the rewards to both the government
and the service users have the potential to be substantial.

In addition, there are areas of significant savings that have been
treated as broadly out of scope for this report. The government is
exploring ways of realising savings in each of these categories, and
there is further explanation on some of these plans in the
[Government Digital Strategy](/digital/strategy/).

####Digitising the wider public sector

Central government’s transactional services cover a significant portion
of public activity, but there are considerable areas of spending that do
not fall within this definition. Services devolved from direct
departmental control, such those run by local councils, the NHS and
the police, are not counted in the savings figures quoted in this
report.

Between £134 million and £421 million could be saved through greater digitisation 
of local government transactions every year

Digitisation could substantially reduce costs across the public sector.
Recently published estimates suggest between £134 million and £421
million could be saved annually through [greater digitisation of local
government transactions](http://www.socitm.net/info/214/socitm_insight/53/briefings/1), while Department of Health
analysis estimates annual savings in the region of [£2.9 billion from
digital deployment in the NHS](http://digital.innovation.nhs.uk/pg/dashboard).

####Consolidating online publishing

In 2011, the government committed to consolidating all information
publishing under a single government domain - the recently launched
[GOV.UK](http://www.gov.uk).

The replacement of Directgov and Businesslink.gov.uk - the previous homes of
online publishing - is expected to yield annual savings of at least £36
million. To this should be added the cost of bringing departmental
websites onto the [GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/) domain which, over time, is expected to realise
annual savings from departmental costs of between £25 million and £45
million for every year over the current spending review period to
2014/15.[^8]

####Rationalising the government IT estate

The government runs a vast network of information technology systems. In
2011/12, government procured over £6 billion of IT systems. This figure
includes a huge range of equipment, from IT hardware used by public
servants to large-scale data storage facilities. Rationalising this
estate could potentially yield substantial savings that will be examined
in the [Government ICT Strategy](http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/content/government-ict-strategy), but one where the reality of
doing so will be subject to multiple contractual arrangements. It is
also likely to present a considerable logistical challenge, and will
need to account for the lessons learned from previous government IT
projects.

####Digitising ‘back office’ and intra-governmental transactional services

The focus of this analysis is restricted to public-facing transactional
services. As such, it rules out any transactions that take place between
government bodies (such as exchanges of information within the criminal
justice system) and those which relate to ‘back office’ functions (such
as government accounting or recruitment).

Many of these processes are currently paper-based and run on a large
scale, raising the possibility of future digital efficiency savings.
