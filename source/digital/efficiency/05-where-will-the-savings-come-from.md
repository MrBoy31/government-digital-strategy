##05 Where will the savings come from?

###The story so far

Some services have already made substantial savings from digitisation.
Based on the historic case study data examined for this report, it is
anticipated that digital savings will primarily be made in the following
areas:

*  total employment costs of those providing the service, including
    training
*  estate and accommodation
*  postage, printing and telecommunications
*  office equipment, including technology systems

The chart below shows a breakdown of the sources of savings based on a
“time and materials” model of savings.[^11]

Figure 6: Sources of savings, by estimated % of total saving
{: .fig #fig-6}

Source | Estimated % of total saving
------ | ---------------------------
78%    | Staff costs
12%    | Accommodation
7%     | Printing & postage
4%     | IT and equipment

The evidence from specific case studies supports these findings. The
[Driving Standards Agency](http://www.dft.gov.uk/dsa) started offering an online channel 
for booking practical driving tests in 2003. More than three-quarters of almost 2
million transactions are now digital, with only 23% of people still
booking via phone. As people have migrated to digital, costs have
fallen. The principal sources of savings have been reductions in
employee numbers and accommodation costs. 1 of 2 dedicated contact
centres closed in 2008, while the total number of employees working on
the transaction has fallen from 400 in 2003 to 75 in 2012. Stationery
and postage costs have also been removed from the digital channel.

Last year, digital take-up across all 4 main business taxes (Self Assessment,
PAYE, Corporation Tax and VAT) was over 80%, equivalent to tens of
millions of transactions.

[HMRC](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk) first offered online tax return filing in 2000, with the pace of
take-up accelerating following the [Carter Review](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/budget2006/carter-review.pdf) in 2006. Last year,
digital take-up across all four main business taxes (Self Assessment,
PAYE, Corporation Tax and VAT) was over 80%, equivalent to tens of
millions of transactions. Dramatically reduced volumes of paper
applications has meant fewer people are required to process them
(resulting in a FTE reduction of over 2,700 over the last 5 years), a
corresponding reduction in the need for their accommodation, less space
to store the paper forms (cumulative savings of almost £5 million), less
stationery (cumulative savings of £34 million) and a smaller spend on
postage.

Responsibility for transactional services is not split evenly across
government departments and their agencies. Some departments are
responsible for many different services, but the majority of those have
relatively low annual volumes of activity. Others are responsible for
fewer services, but some of them involve millions of individual
transactions every year.

Different departments will face different challenges. Those responsible
for managing a small number of bigger services (such as [Department for Work and Pensions (DWP)](http://www.dwp.gov.uk)) are likely
to have to manage significant risks in the process of transforming
them, as failure to deliver a smooth transition will have major impact
on users. Other departments (such as [Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS)](http://www.bis.gov.uk)), responsible for a large
number of transactional services, face the challenges of making
investment cases for lower volume services where savings per service
will be relatively small, as well as managing multiple simultaneous
transformation projects across many different agencies and arm's length
bodies. In addition, in some situations it may be that the overhead costs of, 
for example, a network of local offices, are not reduced by shifting transactions online, 
and so digitisation may not on its own release significant savings from estates in all cases.

The graphs overleaf display the difference between a split of services
and transaction volumes by department. Both of these graphs indicate
that there are some departments that are unlikely to find many savings
through channel shift, simply because they are responsible for very few
services or individual transactions.

###The future potential                           

The future additional savings potential for specific departments is
dependent on 4 things:

*  the number of transactional services the Department is responsible for         
*  how those services are classified against the 4 factors of savings potential (as set out in [Section 2](#what-are-the-savings-from-digitising-transactional-services))         
*  the size of transitional costs involved in releasing savings
*  the extent to which digital savings have already been accounted for in business plans

The estimates below show an approximated range for the total potential
annual savings by department, assuming a shift to the base case for
digitisation set out above. They are based on the top-down methodology
explained earlier, using estimates of total transactional service spend,
channel mix and cost per transaction to calculate the potential savings
from a shift to digital services. Although these savings estimates have
been calculated on the basis of aggregated digital take-up by
department, the purpose of the calculation is to understand the
potential savings from making each individual service digital by
default.

These figures are **inclusive** of any savings arising from digitisation
already included in departmental business plans, and exclude
transitional or investment costs required to release them. As a result,
the upper bound of the range is likely to represent an exaggeration of
the full savings potential. The estimates of transactional costs are based 
on an assessment of the total spending from departments on their services, 
both in the customer-facing part of the service and the back-end processes 
needed to support it. This means that the estimated savings are a combination 
of savings made from greater digitisation of the entire transaction, including 
the back-end processes.

This report does not set out specific details about how and where
departments may realise savings and efficiencies, as this would require
detailed investigation beyond the scope of the analysis. The actual savings potential 
will be as set out in Departmental Digital Strategies published at the end of 2012.
Individual projects for the digitisation or redesign of services will of course need to develop fully costed 
business cases and be managed according to the principles set out in [Managing Public Money](http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/psr_mpm_index.htm).
We recognise that by using historic 11/12 financial data to develop our savings estimates 
they may not fully reflect future policy changes, such as the effects of Universal Credit. 
These changes are likely to impact on the savings potential of specific Departments. A 
fuller explanation of how expected savings were
calculated for each department is set out in [Annex 5](#departmental-savings-methodology).

Realising savings through digitisation is unlikely to happen without
some level of transition costs. Building or redesigning transactional
services is not a trivial activity, and likely to require investment.
Departments are already looking for ways to maintain service quality
whilst reducing their expenditure, and are operating under severely
constrained budgets. However, the case studies provide examples of
services where the business benefits of digital have already outweighed
the upfront costs. Looking forward, the investment case for digital is
likely to be strengthened as government adopts a more agile approach to
digital development and sources technology from a broader range of
smaller suppliers, thereby reducing the levels of required expenditure.             

The [Civil Service Reform Plan](http://www.civilservice.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Civil-Service-Reform-Plan-acc-final.pdf)
indicated that the number of civil servants would fall from 2010 levels by around 23% to 380,000
by 2015 as the way that government delivers its services changes.
Furthermore, the [Public Accounts Committee](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmselect/cmpubacc/503/503.pdf) 
has advised that the savings already achieved in staff costs across the Civil Service “will not be
sustainable unless departments now complete long-term operating models
for their businesses”. Digital services will form a
core element of future government service models and are likely to
thereby contribute to such headcount reductions.

The historical data reveals that a significant proportion of the savings
realisable through digitisation are achieved through a reduction in
staff costs. It is worth noting that these can often be difficult to realise in practice. 
But crucially, the evidence suggests that digitisation could enable the government to 
reduce these costs while maintaining the quality of service that is provided to users. 

If the proportion of savings estimated to relate to staff costs (from Fig. 6) is applied to
the total estimated annual savings and then
divided by an average cost per FTE, this amounts to a total FTE savings
estimate of at least 40,000.[^14] This represents the number
of FTEs that could be saved if a shift towards digital transactions
right across government were achieved.[^15] For the
avoidance of doubt, this estimate is inclusive of any staff savings
already presented in departmental business plans and those departments which have 
developed digital services have generally made assumptions about the impact of 
digital services on their future workforce requirements, so that these are managed over time.
